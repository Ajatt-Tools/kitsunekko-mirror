00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,058
<i>Over 100 years ago,</i>

4
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,810
<i>Titans suddenly appeared</i>

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,772
<i>and devoured most of humanity,
decimating civilisation.</i>

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,571
<i>The survivors built</i>

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,740
<i>three massive concentric walls</i>

8
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,783
<i>to prevent another Titan invasion,</i>

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:37,413
<i>and managed a peaceful life inside.</i>

10
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:43,169
<i>But even though the walls
have stood for 100 years,</i>

11
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,463
<i>there are no guarantees</i>

12
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,131
<i>they won't fall today.</i>

13
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,222
He was fired again!

14
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,600
What a hopeless kid.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,143
Eren? Again?

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,936
What to do with him...

17
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,022
What to do, indeed.

18
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,987
Sorry, Dad,

19
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,572
I need to step out.

20
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,741
Going to see Eren?

21
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,493
Tell him!

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,745
I'm all out of job leads.

23
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,330
I'm going now.

24
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,831
Make it clear.

25
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,458
The usual hill, I bet.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,668
- Be careful.
- Hey there.

27
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,338
- Welcome!
- Can I get some rapeseed oil?

28
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,673
It's a good crop this year.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,509
- A full tank.
- Sure thing.

30
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,100
Outta the way!

31
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,526
Armin!

32
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,529
This thing you made me, it broke.

33
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,324
See?

34
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,037
I'll fix it later.

35
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,083
Don't take too long!

36
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,504
Oh, sorry.

37
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,900
Is Mikasa around?

38
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,026
Mikasa?

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,653
Mikasa!

40
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,655
Yes?

41
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,232
Eren!

42
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,452
I knew you'd be here.

43
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,997
This thing keeps people away.

44
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,124
It's dangerous.

45
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:31,670
Chill out.

46
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,088
It's a dud bomb.

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,134
Eren!

48
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,969
Ow...

49
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,597
What if it explodes?

50
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,683
So be it.

51
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,602
I wouldn't mind

52
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,521
if it blew us all up.

53
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,779
Heard you got fired again.

54
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,114
Only a month into the job.

55
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,492
Longer than the security gig.

56
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,995
Why can't you ever stick with something?

57
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,789
What is it you want to do?

58
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,167
Are you happy

59
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,336
just taking over for your dad?

60
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,260
Look, this runs on batteries.

61
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,719
"Batteries"?

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,434
I want to make more things like these.

63
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,606
Just be careful so you don't get arrested.

64
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,692
And you, Mikasa?

65
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,318
- Me?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,452
I only...

67
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,127
Are you content?

68
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,759
The Inner District is full of
big buildings and rich people.

69
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,015
And lots of stuff you can't find out here.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,267
Don't you want to go?

71
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,858
Then what about outside the Wall?

72
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,989
Born inside the Wall,

73
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,700
and dying inside it...

74
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,290
You're fine with that?

75
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm...

76
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,882
Not.

77
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,974
I'm just like...

78
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,102
This thing.

79
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,816
Wait...

80
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,780
Hey, let me see.

81
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,452
Look.

82
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,661
A woman?

83
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,913
The ocean.

84
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:11,955
"Ocean"?

85
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,625
The big water you mentioned?

86
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,920
This blue thing must be the ocean.

87
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,630
Ocean?

88
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,965
So it was real.

89
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,469
- Not a pond?
- A billion times bigger.

90
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,098
That really exists out there?

91
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,808
Just like I said.

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,490
I wonder if that bird

93
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,077
has seen the ocean.

94
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,545
Wanna see it?

95
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,029
Protecting the Wall instead of people.

96
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,241
Screw that job.

97
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,285
Let's go.

98
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,204
Wait a second.

99
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,546
We can't get near it.

100
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,089
This way.

101
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,892
Hurry, over here.

102
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,895
It'll be fine.

103
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,027
Careful.

104
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,120
Right?

105
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,224
Never seen the Wall this close.

106
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,292
Let's go.

107
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,878
I don't need to go now.

108
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,630
Then when?

109
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,383
If you climb the Wall, you'll be executed.

110
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,470
And they say the outside is full of Titans.

111
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,848
Due to a huge bomb,
only Titans can survive outside.

112
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,352
You seriously believe in Titans?

113
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,648
No one's seen them in over 100 years.

114
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,652
Yet we're holed up in here, afraid of them.

115
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,613
I'm sick of it.

116
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,660
Maybe the other side

117
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,037
is paradise.

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,375
Hey, what're you doing?

119
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,754
You renegades!

120
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,047
Come!

121
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,549
This is off limits!

122
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,634
Don't touch her!

123
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,095
Stop resisting!

124
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,472
That was uncalled for!

125
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,808
Armin, don't!

126
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,146
That's enough.

127
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,689
You'll be executed!

128
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,441
Hey, hey...

129
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,736
You haven't changed.

130
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,282
Old man Souda...

131
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,164
Leave this to me.

132
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,958
You guys can go. Hey!

133
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,376
They're just kids.

134
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,713
Here.

135
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,548
Go.

136
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,051
Go on.

137
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,557
So, trying to show off in front of her?

138
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,017
It's not like that.

139
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,395
I get it, I get it.

140
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,233
I was caught doing the same thing as a kid.

141
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,612
I asked your mom to come along.

142
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,117
Your dad ended up winning her, though.

143
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,996
This isn't about that.

144
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,708
It just pisses me off.

145
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,339
"Even paradise could become a prison

146
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,593
"if you take notice of the walls."

147
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,518
Now, don't tell the others about this.

148
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,604
We're starting a scout.

149
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,897
A scout?

150
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,566
You're going outside?

151
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,735
Lies, it'll fall through again.

152
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,572
It won't.
Looks like the council will finally pass it.

153
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,701
The public discontent is rising.

154
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,788
You're really

155
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,290
going outside the Wall?

156
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,877
We're forming a Scout Regiment.

157
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,295
Eren,

158
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,798
how about it?

159
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,552
Once we find new land,

160
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,054
we're free to live anywhere.

161
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,856
Mikasa.

162
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,332
- An earthquake?
- Too big for an earthquake.

163
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,257
The Wall's shaking.

164
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,719
It's from outside.

165
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,096
Eren, no!

166
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,744
So they're real.

167
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,079
It's taller than the Wall.

168
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,664
This can't be...

169
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,792
I thought we were safe!

170
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,137
There's something there.

171
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,016
What is that?

172
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,769
Remember our drills!

173
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,916
Run! The Wall will be breached!

174
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,350
The town!

175
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,646
Hey! Run this way!

176
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,622
Aim the cannons at the Titan!

177
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,291
Aim the cannons at the Titan!

178
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,792
- Prepare the cannons!
- Hurry!

179
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:36,960
Prepare the cannons!

180
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,378
We don't have permission

181
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,046
to use gunpowder yet...

182
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,467
Hurry, they're coming!

183
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,678
Hurry!

184
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,265
Don't panic! Remember the drills!

185
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,884
Look at those faces...

186
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,572
Prepare the cannons!

187
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,075
- Draw them in!
- Yes, sir!

188
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,743
Prepare the cannons!

189
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,745
Cattle.

190
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,415
Cattle, cattle.

191
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,797
- Ready to fire!
- Fire!

192
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,349
It's a hit!

193
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,851
Did we get it?

194
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,785
The legend was true.

195
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,247
They're immortal.

196
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,209
Reload!

197
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,507
Reload!

198
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,633
Come on!

199
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,718
Hurry!

200
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,470
What're you doing?

201
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,013
It's hopeless.

202
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,642
Kill the Titan!

203
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,115
Help me! I'm sorry...

204
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,203
I'm sorry!

205
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,052
Squad Leader! Squad Leader!

206
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,699
Let's run!

207
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,243
Armin!

208
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,263
That thing won't...

209
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,407
I'm gonna check on my home!

210
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,417
Armin, run...

211
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,086
That's Armin's dad.

212
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,171
Let's go!

213
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,603
Don't cry!

214
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,523
Let us in!

215
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,316
Don't push!

216
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,113
Wait!

217
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,992
Wait!

218
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,576
That woman...

219
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,578
I'll go.

220
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,085
Get up! Get up!

221
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:37,964
I'll get the baby.

222
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,052
Mikasa!

223
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,934
That's it, close it!

224
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,312
Now! Close that door!

225
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,399
Mikasa!

226
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,498
Why?

227
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,625
There's still room!

228
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,669
Don't you dare open it!

229
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,255
The Titans are coming!

230
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,342
Only trying to save yourselves...

231
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,693
Mikasa!

232
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,614
Mikasa.

233
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,786
Hold him down!

234
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,371
Let me go!

235
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,833
Mikasa!

236
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,226
Mikasa...

237
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,749
Help!

238
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,111
Two Years Later

239
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,488
The price for our years of peace

240
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,033
was paid for with tragedy.

241
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,038
The Outer Wall in the Monzen District

242
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,459
was destroyed by a Titan
larger than ever imagined.

243
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,422
Unable to counter the surge of Titans,

244
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,050
we abandoned the agricultural zone

245
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,722
and retreated behind the Middle Wall
to the commercial zone.

246
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,227
With hordes of refugees

247
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,397
and the loss of farmlands,

248
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,442
our food shortage is becoming dire.

249
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,238
In order to reclaim our farmlands,

250
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,034
we must restore the broken Outer Wall.

251
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,828
This, we vowed!

252
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,749
It is to carry out this prestigious mission

253
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,377
that you have all completed your training.

254
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,380
- Weapons Squad Leader Hans.
- Sir!

255
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,720
The days of our being trampled
by Titans are over.

256
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,474
Now we have omni-directional mobility gear!

257
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,403
With ODMG,

258
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,447
victory will be ours!

259
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,037
At the Omotemachi transit point,

260
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,749
we will join the recon team
led by Captain Shikishima.

261
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,584
Captain Shikishima!

262
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,088
We will depart for Monzen at sunset.

263
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,260
May you fight to honour
the spirits of the war dead.

264
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,388
Give your hearts!

265
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,098
Give your hearts!

266
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,942
I'll be back, so take care of Mom.

267
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,152
The family's in your hands.

268
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,283
Now that's a good daughter.

269
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,077
You were always a glutton,

270
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,246
never making yourself useful...

271
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,208
Sasha, pick 'em up! Pick 'em up, I said!

272
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,544
- I'm sorry.
- Just do it, Sasha.

273
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,546
I can't get it.

274
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,133
Jean, my son, you must take revenge for me.

275
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,511
Jean, become the pride of our clan.

276
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,347
Offer your soul
to the spirits of the war dead...

277
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,057
Jean! Jean!

278
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,976
My son!

279
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,812
Mommy's only going to be
gone for a little bit, OK?

280
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,272
Just be a good girl and...

281
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,314
Riko!

282
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,317
Riko!

283
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,615
Hey, don't cry, little brother...

284
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,658
Hey, hey...

285
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:06,120
Koyuki, who's this?
Is this supposed to be me?

286
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,205
It's a little fat to be me, no?

287
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,001
Hey, don't cry, I'll be fine.

288
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,673
Cry baby.

289
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,345
No one's gonna be waiting for us.

290
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,685
Mister.

291
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,616
Here, you can have this.

292
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,454
Thanks.

293
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:53,167
Koyuki, your brother's leaving now.

294
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,210
Brother...

295
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,419
Koyuki, let's go.

296
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,391
Here.

297
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,434
Thank you.

298
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,570
That's mine.

299
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,450
Mr Souda.

300
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,078
Armin.

301
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:30,913
Old man Souda?

302
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,207
Eren?

303
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:37,920
So you're alive!

304
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:48,931
So now...

305
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,102
You boys, too.

306
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,897
Well, everyone died.

307
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,656
What happened to the girl?

308
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,455
- It was my fault.
- That's not true.

309
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,463
That's why

310
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,592
I'm going to kill it.

311
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,677
Revenge on the Titans, eh?

312
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,974
Killing one or two

313
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,227
won't make a difference, you know.

314
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,988
Why did you volunteer, then?

315
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,825
To see my wife and child.

316
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:52,912
They're waiting.

317
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,464
Excuse me!

318
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,550
Who're you?

319
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,596
I'm sorry.

320
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:15,517
Are you finished?

321
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,735
Are you even listening?

322
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,655
Look, right now,

323
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,490
the Outer Wall in Monzen

324
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,534
has a hole in it like this.

325
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,204
So we detonate this portion

326
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,956
to plug that hole.

327
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,875
The Wall here becomes shorter,

328
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:43,587
but it's twice as tall as the Titans.

329
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:47,341
So we can stop any more
Titans from entering.

330
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,844
That's the Outer Wall Restoration Mission.

331
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,388
Once we plug that hole,

332
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,473
we exterminate the Titans inside!

333
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,939
Sasha.

334
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:10,447
But previous restoration
missions failed miserably.

335
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,534
They were attacked by Titans
before reaching the Wall,

336
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,577
and ran out of explosives.

337
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,081
We no longer have materials
to make the bombs.

338
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:23,752
All that's left are
the last explosives in Omotemachi.

339
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,090
If we fail,

340
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,261
it'll be the end of humanity.

341
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:38,434
We have no choice.

342
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,602
You don't have to.

343
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,610
Pipsqueaks like you just get in the way.

344
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:54,033
Not just you, look around.

345
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,202
Just a bunch of useless bums.

346
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,623
It's been a long war of attrition.

347
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,461
Inevitably there will be
more inexperienced folks.

348
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,962
Sure.

349
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:12,259
But even the Scout Regiment
was wiped out in this mission.

350
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,386
Instead, we've got

351
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,850
a potato girl whose mind is only on eating...

352
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,066
Seconds, please.

353
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,276
How could you eat right now?

354
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,987
Sorry, lady.

355
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,159
Not enough farmlands.

356
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:41,080
But I was told workers won't ever go hungry.

357
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,831
How naïve are you?

358
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,376
Your parents sold you to save costs.

359
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,717
You all came here because
you couldn't find work.

360
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,847
Now I'm being lumped with
you scum who're just here to die.

361
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,935
Stop with this talk of dying.

362
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,441
I can't... I just can't do this!

363
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,777
Lil, Lil, Lil...

364
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,906
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

365
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,078
Damn love birds, get a room.

366
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,747
He seems annoyed.

367
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,707
He's afraid of Titans.

368
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,795
You nailed it.

369
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,676
Titans are like nothing to me.

370
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,345
Do Titans have nipples?

371
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,850
Do they have nipples?

372
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,896
You talk big for having never seen one.

373
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,234
Just a spoiled brat from inland.

374
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,158
- Say that again.
- They don't!

375
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:05,414
I told you, Titans have
no reproductive organs.

376
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,292
So they have no nipples, either.

377
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,711
How they propagate is a mystery.

378
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,840
I want to dissect one,
but they evaporate when they die.

379
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,259
So I need a live Titan!

380
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,887
I want to do this!

381
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,603
Gather in 10 minutes for gear check.

382
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,605
Yes, sir!

383
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,569
Oh, that reminds me...

384
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:40,574
There was a guy who abandoned
his girl when he saw a Titan.

385
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,203
Bet he's missing his nuts, too.

386
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,750
Hey, stop it! Knock it off!

387
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,258
Why do you two always go at it?

388
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,594
Sannagi, let me down!

389
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,808
Let go of me!

390
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,896
We gather in 10.

391
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,126
Hey, pick up the pace!

392
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,628
This way!

393
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,256
Hurry up!

394
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,842
Don't lag!

395
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,103
It'll be OK.

396
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,196
You're going home.

397
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,866
You're from Monzen, right?

398
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,536
Everyone died.

399
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,330
I want to go home, too.

400
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,502
Sannagi, were you from a Yuen farm?

401
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,506
Yeah, I want to go home and farm again.

402
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,718
For my brothers and sisters.

403
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,971
I'd do anything for them.

404
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,351
The old road to Omotemachi.

405
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:35,897
Titans sleep at night,
and their eyes won't work anyway.

406
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,025
So we'll go straight to Omotemachi by dawn.

407
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,068
But do not raise your voices.

408
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,988
Titans are very responsive to human voices.

409
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:44,906
And the other Titans will notice.

410
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,908
Bite your tongue before you scream!

411
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:51,079
If you don't want to die,
get to Omotemachi by dawn.

412
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,248
- Open the gate!
- Open the gate!

413
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,594
Ready to move out, sir!

414
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,930
Move out.

415
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,617
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

416
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,322
Past this hell, the Goddess
awaits at Omotemachi.

417
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:08,990
The Goddess?

418
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,450
You don't know?

419
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,662
The Titan-slaying female
squad leader under Shikishima.

420
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:17,416
They say she killed over
10 Titans in half a year.

421
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,837
Sounds more like a Grim Reaper
than a goddess.

422
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,014
- I'm afraid.
- Don't worry.

423
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,360
There's something there.

424
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,571
Stop the vehicles.

425
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,202
- Already there?
- Awfully early.

426
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,212
What's going on? This isn't Omotemachi.

427
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,424
Check the premises. Move out.

428
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,737
Oh, come on.

429
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,155
What is it?

430
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,700
Just cattle.

431
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,869
Do Titans only eat humans?

432
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:21,331
Forward. Each squad to the front.

433
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,761
Potato Girl, you'll wake up
the Titans with that noise.

434
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:37,973
Here.

435
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,849
Not enough?

436
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,735
You always feed me.

437
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,488
Wait.

438
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:58,034
Still no Titans coming out.
We should get there by dawn.

439
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:03,415
Hey, don't say it aloud. You'll jinx us.

440
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,795
All clear, let's go.

441
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,682
I hear a child...

442
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,398
A child left behind.

443
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,899
Don't be stupid.

444
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,654
We have to help.

445
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,656
Hey.

446
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,160
We have to help.

447
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,261
Hiana.

448
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,890
I can hear it.

449
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,090
Shit.

450
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,406
We're close.

451
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,127
Get up!

452
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,346
Those idiots.

453
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,563
Where? Where are they?

454
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,273
Hey, keep it down.

455
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,317
You'll wake up the Titans.

456
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,694
Keep calm. Keep calm!

457
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,571
Keep calm!

458
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,824
No matter what happens...

459
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,707
Captain!

460
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,046
They brought them.

461
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,566
Director General!

462
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,445
Go! Go!

463
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,197
Forward!

464
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,491
Hey, wait!

465
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,409
We're not on yet!

466
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:11,579
You guys, wait!

467
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:14,040
There are tall buildings up ahead!

468
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,000
Run and meet us there!

469
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,085
We're not fighting?

470
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,254
- What about the ODMG?
- Where do we fire them?

471
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,881
We can't beat them head-on.

472
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,185
Go!

473
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,826
Armin!

474
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,746
Sannagi!

475
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,763
Don't raise your voices...

476
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,255
We're almost there! Run!

477
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,510
- We're there!
- That's Omotemachi!

478
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,351
Kill them!

479
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,063
<i>Titans are not invincible.</i>

480
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,024
Even if you destroy their limbs

481
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,944
or head, they'll quickly regenerate.

482
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,446
But this spot right here!

483
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,575
If the nape is severely damaged,

484
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,661
it will perish without regenerating.

485
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,206
However, it's difficult to
attack this area with firearms.

486
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,752
Currently, what's most effective is this.

487
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:24,879
The omni-directional mobility gear!

488
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,550
<i>With this on our hips, we can move
quickly and freely in the air.</i>

489
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:33,721
Fire the anchor and reel it in
to lift yourself up.

490
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,557
<i>Maintain the height as you aim for the nape.</i>

491
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,645
<i>Of course, remember to evade
the Titan's attacks.</i>

492
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,399
Then use the blades to carve
the flesh from the nape.

493
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,069
<i>Without its nape, the Titan will die.</i>

494
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:52,115
Once a Titan dies, its body will evaporate.

495
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:58,454
<i>At present, this is the only
known method of killing a Titan.</i>

496
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,416
The Scout Regiment!

497
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,668
That's Captain Shikishima.

498
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,629
Wouldn't mind a hot Titan chick for once.

499
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,926
They're still here!

500
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,101
We're finished!

501
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,895
I'm tying it. Hang in there.

502
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,068
Director General Kubal is here.

503
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,870
You guarded the explosives well.

504
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,582
I attempted to inspect the contents,

505
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:11,420
but this was impossible to open.

506
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,653
Director General, what about the explosives?

507
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,033
There are rumours of an insurgency, you see.

508
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,174
I see.

509
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,677
Certainly safe down there.

510
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:03,347
Sorry, it was top secret.

511
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,437
Finish loading by dawn!

512
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,691
They're our last explosives,
treat them with care.

513
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,245
You messed this whole thing up!

514
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,751
If you wanna die, do it alone!

515
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:35,129
You've got a death wish.

516
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,637
You smell, you spoiled brat.

517
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:48,309
You peed in your pants, huh?

518
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,605
The Titans scared you?

519
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:58,945
Hey!

520
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:01,864
Stop it.

521
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,408
Stop it!

522
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,344
You're too slow.

523
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,304
You're the one who's slow.

524
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,348
Thanks.

525
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,196
What the hell...

526
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:44,824
Enough with the disturbance.

527
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:48,828
Mikasa.

528
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,375
Mikasa, it's you, right? What happened?

529
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:06,971
Nice kick...

530
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,390
It's Captain Shikishima!

531
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,934
...for just messing around.

532
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:14,895
Rookie, your name?

533
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,690
Eren. I'm Eren!

534
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:23,112
Eren?

535
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,327
From Monzen?

536
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,043
Your parents?

537
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:41,422
They died. I was too young to remember.

538
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:42,465
I see.

539
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,634
About Mikasa...

540
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,764
Why is she...

541
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,766
Why?

542
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,809
Why what?

543
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,438
Why is she able to toy with Titans?

544
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,692
I taught her.

545
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,653
You want to learn, too, huh?

546
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:07,782
Well, of course...

547
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,659
I want to defeat the Titans.

548
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:13,037
Why?

549
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,456
Because I hate them...

550
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,667
Those Titans.

551
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,211
Why do you hate them?

552
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,464
Because

553
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,967
they're the ones who trapped us in.

554
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,471
Wrong.

555
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,518
The true enemy

556
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,438
isn't the Titans.

557
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,148
The true enemy?

558
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,489
The true enemy

559
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:51,909
is safety.

560
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,331
What do you call animals that live

561
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,418
inside fences in fear of wolves?

562
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:05,714
Cattle.

563
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,175
And what are you?

564
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:09,677
I'm...

565
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,638
Not!

566
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,101
Then go fly.

567
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:18,811
Fly?

568
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,485
You can only gain by letting go.

569
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:50,968
The kid I gave this to... He died.

570
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:05,065
I hear there used to be lots of machines.

571
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,943
People back then even flew the skies.

572
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,408
But now it's forbidden.

573
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,878
- Director General!
- At ease.

574
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:33,636
Tell me, did you learn in school
what that technological advancement

575
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,096
led to?

576
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,433
Environmental destruction,
wasted resources,

577
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,769
useless competition and war.

578
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:43,395
Precisely.

579
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,149
Now get yourself some good rest.

580
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,984
Yes, sir!

581
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,577
At daybreak, we head for Monzen.

582
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:01,455
Inspect your gear and rest up.

583
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,086
Fighting is the one thing

584
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,130
he was always good at.

585
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,176
You reek of booze.

586
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,680
Why do you hate that guy so much?

587
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,432
His face...

588
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:24,144
As if he's carrying
the world's misery by himself.

589
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,565
He lost his girlfriend, right?

590
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,987
Her name was Mikasa.

591
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,651
Mikasa.

592
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,669
I'm just...

593
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,386
Glad.

594
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:43,515
Glad?

595
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,447
That baby was eaten.

596
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,750
And so was I.

597
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,117
The world is cruel.

598
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,794
I'm just going to kill Titans.

599
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,651
Sorry.

600
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:20,863
Did I interrupt?

601
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,826
No.

602
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,386
Want it? It's good.

603
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,129
Calling the Titans again?

604
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,429
Sorry.

605
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,811
It should be me apologising.

606
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:20,899
Forget it.

607
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,994
What happened between
you and Squad Leader Mikasa?

608
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,668
Still act like a kid, huh?

609
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:43,881
It doesn't matter any more.

610
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:48,468
- There's someone here.
- It's fine, they're not looking.

611
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,553
Hey, wait.

612
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,139
Your back feel OK?

613
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,309
Lil, I love you.

614
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:59,021
Wonder if those two will get to marry.

615
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,614
If they make it home alive.

616
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:13,410
It's not right that we need
permission to get married.

617
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,625
And even if you have a baby...

618
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,174
Riko...

619
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,680
You have a daughter, was it?

620
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:42,397
By volunteering for duty, I get child support.

621
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:56,453
You OK with a single mother?

622
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:18,225
Will you be father to my daughter?

623
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,640
I don't want to die! No, let me go!

624
01:06:58,724 --> 01:06:59,766
Riko!

625
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,658
We're surrounded! We're under attack!

626
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,285
We're under attack!

627
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,494
We're under attack!

628
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:21,580
Hurry! Put on your ODMG!

629
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:23,290
Lil!

630
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,919
The enemy's here!

631
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,424
- Lil, let's go!
- Wait!

632
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,599
Defend the explosives!

633
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,273
Too narrow here to fire our anchors!

634
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:50,192
ODMG troops to the rooftop!

635
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:52,152
Damn!

636
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:01,912
Four ahead, you go left.

637
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,497
Will do.

638
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:21,098
Quit fidgeting, at least die with dignity.

639
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:27,372
Die!

640
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:38,383
Come on, move it!

641
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:42,429
Stop, stop it! I, I...

642
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:44,598
Just come!

643
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,726
It's all about the explosives!

644
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,811
Defend them at all costs!

645
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:55,442
This side is gone, retreat!

646
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:03,742
Come.

647
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,539
Hey, wake up! I said wake up!

648
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:12,959
Please, wake up...

649
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,004
It's dangerous here, let's go.

650
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,883
Wait!

651
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,302
Will you please treat him?

652
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,932
I'm sorry, but your boyfriend is...

653
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:31,770
No!

654
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:35,190
Fukushi...

655
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,610
We have to go.

656
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,614
Let me go! Let me go!

657
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,158
I'll kill them Titans!

658
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,993
I'll kill them!

659
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,500
Let's go.

660
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,924
Hey. Who's driving that?

661
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,551
No one gave you permission!

662
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,805
Thief! He's stealing the explosives!

663
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:11,476
Stop! Stop! Get out!

664
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,704
Move!

665
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,500
Die, you Titans!

666
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:07,699
Stop it! Stop the vehicle!

667
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:09,492
- Why's it on fire?
- Stop it!

668
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,538
There you are!

669
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:17,083
I'll kill you all!

670
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,132
Get down! Get down!

671
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:25,467
Fukushi...

672
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:36,811
How pretty.

673
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:40,774
But such a waste.

674
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,240
The explosives. That was it!

675
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,492
Don't! You're gonna die!

676
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,414
How could this happen?

677
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,257
This belonged to the thief.

678
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:38,039
This is hell...

679
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,506
What are you doing here?

680
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,848
Humans are...

681
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,310
Weak, you see.

682
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,318
We'll be eaten.

683
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,699
Now's the chance. Let's run.

684
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:19,539
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?

685
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,040
Cattle.

686
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,375
And what are you?

687
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:23,960
I'm not!

688
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,336
Then go fly.

689
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:29,674
<i>Then go fly.</i>

690
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:37,557
I can't! There's no way we're going to win!

691
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:42,395
Then be that way for the rest of your life!

692
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,247
That bastard...

693
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,422
Damn it.

694
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:11,591
You can't fear being caught!

695
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,177
Fly right into them!

696
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,762
Fly!

697
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:31,694
Close one.

698
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:35,031
Always go back to deliver the final blow.

699
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:37,075
I'll do it!

700
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:40,745
You're mine!

701
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,486
Well, sometimes we're unlucky.

702
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,203
Hey!

703
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,914
Hey, look!

704
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,293
Jean!

705
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,256
He only talked big.

706
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,467
Everyone, I have a plan.

707
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:54,694
Hey!

708
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,656
Pull back.

709
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:03,077
Hey, big guy! Wanna eat more?

710
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,205
Then try eating me!
You can never eat enough!

711
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,502
What, you clunkhead? You angry, huh?

712
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,129
Mr Souda, please...

713
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,218
Guys...

714
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:22,221
Come here, Titans!

715
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:26,392
Come on, you slowpokes!

716
01:17:58,966 --> 01:17:59,967
Now!

717
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:07,350
Don't mess with me!

718
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:09,435
Well done!

719
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:11,479
Good, let's move on!

720
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,482
Where's Eren?

721
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,442
Somewhere up there, dead.

722
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,369
Armin!

723
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,406
Damn, they're not working!

724
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:58,377
Armin!

725
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:29,575
Armin!

726
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,289
I won't let you

727
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,377
die here!

728
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:47,844
Eren!

729
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:51,264
Armin!

730
01:21:34,432 --> 01:21:35,433
Hiana!

731
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:00,833
<i>I'm driving you all out.</i>

732
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,262
We're done here! It's full of Titans!

733
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,514
Something's calling them.

734
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,975
- Where's Captain Shikishima?
- Fighting, probably.

735
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:20,269
Where's the Director General
and the Guards?

736
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,021
They already evacuated.

737
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:25,858
Don't tell me they used us as bait.

738
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,821
Don't come near!

739
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,115
Hey, get away, Minami!

740
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:36,494
Minami!

741
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,250
Mikasa.

742
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:51,092
Eren was eaten.

743
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,057
It was my fault.

744
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,398
I'm sorry.

745
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,664
I'll carve an escape path.

746
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,917
Our task is still to kill Titans.

747
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,839
You can't! You're almost out of gas!

748
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:26,645
Come!

749
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:36,090
What was that voice?

750
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:42,555
What's going on?

751
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:52,565
A Titan attacking a Titan?

752
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:57,736
What's happening?

753
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:58,904
What's with that arm?

754
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:00,865
It's regenerating so fast!

755
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,838
They're gathering here.

756
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:04,720
Is he on our side?

757
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,856
His fighting clearly
demonstrates intelligence.

758
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:39,338
I've never seen this!

759
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,854
It's him...

760
01:28:29,555 --> 01:28:31,140
Mikasa, get back here!

761
01:28:39,273 --> 01:28:41,233
Like hell he's on our side!

762
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:43,902
Eren?

763
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:47,990
Is it my fault?

764
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:27,780
Mikasa.

765
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,366
- You OK?
- Can you stand?

766
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:45,381
Is he dead? So he's finally out of steam.

767
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,592
He'll evaporate! He's gonna evaporate!

768
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,552
Ow, it's steaming hot!

769
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:54,014
Cut open his nape,
but don't injure the inside!

770
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:55,974
What? What're you talking about?

771
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:59,061
Just do it!
Hurry or he'll be absorbed into the Titan!

772
01:29:59,812 --> 01:30:01,480
The cells will assimilate!

773
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:03,816
What?

774
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,267
- Is that Eren?
- Eren...

775
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:43,021
I see.

776
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:46,692
So that's why the Titans'
weak spot is the nape.

777
01:30:53,991 --> 01:31:00,164
"Be careful when you fight
the monsters, lest you become one."

778
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:29,902

Jun Kunimura

791
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:32,130
Are you a human? Or a Titan?

792
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,259
<i>Eren is humanity's last hope.</i>

793
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:36,635
We're not cattle.

794
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:39,096
What triggers explosive cell divisions?

795
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,139
They're like-minded comrades.

796
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:42,808
His consciousness is overtaken by instinct.

797
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:45,686
<i>We must nip evil in the bud.</i>

798
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,354
<i>This might solve the mystery.</i>

799
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:48,647
<i>I've been waiting.</i>

800
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:51,066
I've already given my heart to the cause!

801
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,859
<i>Without me, you'll all die.</i>

802
01:32:52,943 --> 01:32:54,695
I won't abandon anyone any more!

803
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,655
<i>So fight with us!</i>

804
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,117
<i>With nothing to protect, you'll be strong.</i>

805
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,327
<i>I want to know the truth about this world!</i>

806
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:03,453
You'll die!

807
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,038
<i>You were chosen.</i>

808
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:06,206
<i>You did that to your own son?</i>

809
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,291
Hurry, go!

810
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:09,626
<i>As long as we've kept fighting,
we haven't lost!</i>

811
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:13,088
<i>It's hell outside the Wall!</i>

812
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,172
<i>You were always with me.</i>

813
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:15,507
Mikasa!

814
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,177

1
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,780
おはよう

2
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,680
こんにちは、国連調停官事務所の者ですが

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,740
お手伝いに来ました

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,300
ここで合ってますか？

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,200
たぶん、合ってると思う

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,020
お肉を分けてもらう仕事よね

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,070
え-ええ、はい

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,350
先生

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,020
先生じゃありません？

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,830
調停官の先生ですよね

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,950
どうしたんです？先生？

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,030
先生

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,590
一ヶ月で一センチ

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,440
元の長さに戻るまで
まだ時間がかかる事でしょう

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,120
先生

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,910
おはようございます、皆さん

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,800
先生、最近はちっとも姿をお見かけしませんでしたね

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,680
私達とっても心配していたんですよ

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,550
ご病気なんじゃないかって

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,580
ああ・・・

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,800
いえ、ちょっと学術調査に出ていって、
祖父の手伝いで

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,490
学術調査

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,080
古代への冒険

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,810
知性と文化の泉

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,080
素敵

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,690
どうも・・・

27
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,710
あの、今日は力仕事と聞いて来たんですが

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,330
見事にお嬢さんばかり集まったみたいですね

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,015
今日は、別の共同作業

30
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,179
狩りがあるみたいだから

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,660
皆が狩りとは、
食料不足もいよいよ深刻なんでしょうかね

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,120
Oh, sorry for arriving late.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,300
Anyway, I need to go join the others.

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,320
Mediator...

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,220
Yes?

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,090
You're in charge, so you'll
need to lead the others.

37
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,720
You'll find hot water and other
tools inside the building.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,930
Oh...

39
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,980
The chickens in the front room
have stopped laying eggs.

40
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Turn them all into meat.

41
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,100
Huh?

42
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,200
The Fairies' Secret Factory

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,460
Turn them all into meat?

44
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,750
{\an9}Live Chickens

45
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,750
Juicy Chicken
(Delicious!)

46
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,750
What, exactly, is the second step in this process?

47
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,760
Well, I already know the answer.

48
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,640
I keep a pet sparrow at home.

49
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,330
I couldn't bring myself to do it!

50
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,930
I refuse.

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,610
I also refuse...

52
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,600
Mediator!

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,040
Looks like it's all up to me...

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,020
Mediator,

55
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,930
please use your knowledge to help us!

56
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,740
Huh?

57
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,910
Er, that's...

58
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,570
Wait, what?

59
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,970
Mediator!

60
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,110
Mediator, please show us how it's done!

61
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,160
Necessary murder.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,430
Humans must kill to live.

63
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,460
That hasn't changed,
even with humankind's decline.

64
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,090
The situation has reached the point at
which escape and refusal are no longer options,

65
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,550
so I must act.

66
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,810
They're escaping to the outside!

67
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,230
What do we do?!

68
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,980
We'll be in trouble...

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,600
It appears that

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,830
they have discovered new strength,
in the face of adversity.

71
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,120
Hey, Mediator...

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
What will become of our meat?

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,740
The answer is plain to see.

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,490
The chickens have earned the right to live,

75
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,750
while the humans will go hungry.

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,460
Ah, another negative...

77
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,750
Negative?

78
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,550
I have a habit of looking for
the negatives in life.

79
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,380
You should definitely break that habit.

80
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,140
I want to eat some meat.

81
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,390
This isn't enough to keep me going.

82
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,150
The men didn't return with
anything from their hunt, either.

83
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,780
Well, that's true...

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,080
Under normal circumstances, we'd have been dressed down

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,950
for having let the chickens escape.  But...

86
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,800
Since they
abandoned their posts,

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,330
Abandoned their posts

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,570
the men also
shared the blame,

89
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,700
Men shared the blame

90
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,330
and it was considered a wash.

91
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,330
A wash

92
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,580
You can't have what isn't there.
Be happy with what there is.

93
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,330
I'm complaining because I'm not.

94
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,980
I don't mind foregoing meat
for consecutive days.

95
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,340
However, this shortage affects
more than just the humans...

96
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh, there isn't any?

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,100
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,830
No sweets...

99
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,390
The village is running short on supplies.

100
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,970
No supplies?

101
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,910
What are supplies?

102
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,860
All kinds of stuff!

103
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,900
What happens without supplies?

104
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,650
Death by starvation.

105
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,900
A brutal way to die.

106
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,660
But it's new and exciting.

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
Very original.

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,170
It could become a fad!

109
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,540
Fad! Fad!

110
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,970
Fairies.

111
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,970
The present-humans who,
despite their adorable appearance,

112
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,530
possess supernatural technology.

113
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,010
They are called fairies.

114
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,140
I serve as a UN Mediator,

115
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,300
liaising between the fairies and humans.

116
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
You can't have what isn't there.

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,600
Be happy with what there is.

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,810
Show that you can suck it up?

119
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,150
Then you get to brag!

120
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,720
Then the humans might respect us?

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,290
They might give us sweets if they respect us.

122
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,190
So we suck it up for one day?

123
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,700
No, there probably won't be
any tomorrow, either.

124
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,590
Really?

125
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,800
What about after two days?

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,860
After three days?

127
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,950
Four days?

128
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,790
Ah, it's probably going to be a lot longer...

129
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,790
When do I get my sweet, sweet reward?

130
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,290
Probably...

131
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,790
Probably?

132
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,720
When the food situation has improved...

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,050
Maybe next year?

134
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,920
Oh, but I came up with a new gum

135
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,930
that only requires a little flour.

136
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,300
Gum doesn't count as sweets.

137
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,940
That means...

138
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,620
You can't ingest gum.

139
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,320
So it doesn't count as food.

140
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,560
It vanishes while you're
chewing the wrapper.

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Vanishes! Vanished!

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,740
Goes poof!

143
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Well, those are good points.

144
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,750
But gum is all I can manage
in sufficient quantities.

145
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Is this the sad end of a material culture?

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,380
Humankind's sad end began a long time ago.

147
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,260
Very soon, we'll be extinct.

148
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,760
What?

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,240
Hang in there!

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,740
Don't give up!

151
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,010
Let's spend more time together.

152
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,510
Yep, they're adorable...

153
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,520
Oh, I know.

154
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,650
Fairy collection box complete!

155
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,280
They won't reproduce

156
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,940
if you keep them in separate rooms,
so it's very convenient.

157
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,600
Yuck...

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,360
Serving this to the others would
have been a bad idea.

159
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,960
I'll need to find some
ingredients for sweets soon.

160
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,250
A few days later,

161
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,490
the local UNCC office received word
that some suspicious items

162
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,680
were being circulated in the village.

163
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,190
Oh, these are FairyCo canned goods?

164
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,030
FairyCo

165
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,020
They started circulating all of a sudden?

166
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,260
It sounds like people are confused

167
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,660
because a whole pile just popped up.

168
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,140
Shouldn't we be grateful,

169
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,020
given the current food shortage?

170
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,530
They're too scared

171
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,290
to touch processed foods
from an unknown source.

172
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,930
Do we have the fairies to blame again?

173
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,290
I mean, the fairies to thank?

174
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,310
Ah, due to the new influx of goods,

175
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,970
the marketplace is busy.

176
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,300
Oh, it's you!

177
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,020
What happened to you?

178
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,520
It looks terrible...

179
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,350
Your hair was better long.

180
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,190
Short hair and long skirts don't mix.

181
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,780
{\i1}I bet that when they run out of delicacy points (DP),

182
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,220
{\i1}girls turn into old ladies.

183
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,070
{\i1}How many DP do I have left?

184
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,070
How many DP do I have left?

185
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,040
That isn't how city folk dress...

186
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,280
You look so plain.

187
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm getting hammered.

188
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,450
I love to sit in narrow spaces
when I'm feeling down.

189
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,340
Assistant?

190
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,270
Oh,

191
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,710
I heard from Grandpa...

192
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,850
These are from the bazaar?

193
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,850
Then I'll take a look.

194
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,230
Relics of a long-lost culture of waste...

195
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,140
What did you trade for these?

196
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,240
Vouchers?

197
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,250
Eh? These were free?

198
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,240
There's so much, you can
take whatever you want?

199
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,740
The stock is resupplied
when no one is looking?

200
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,720
I see.

201
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,500
It's just like everyone said...

202
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,370
These peaches are sweet!

203
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,500
But...

204
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,510
Oh, those look greasy!

205
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,260
It tastes just as I would expect.

206
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,270
But it feels like I'm eating some substance
molded into a sardine shape...

207
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,250
Assistant, could you take
these cans to Grandpa?

208
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,000
We need to find out if these are safe to eat.

209
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,650
I'm also seeing plenty of sundries...

210
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,790
FairyCo Hair Growth Medication
~A Cambrian explosion of hair~
Perfect for someone who had to
cut their hair after losing a bet!

211
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,220
Th-This is...

212
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,180
I got so excited, I forgot what I was doing...

213
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,300
My hair's back!

214
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
FairyCo Testimonial
*Results may vary

215
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,300
Er, but it worked too well...

216
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,480
What did FairyCo put in this?

217
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,560
Uh-oh...

218
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:59,780
First Camphorwood Village Meeting on Meat
Topic: Recovery of chickens that escaped
during previous communal meat preparation
Participation: Attendance mandatory for
any related parties

219
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,780
I'd been hoping that the chicken
incident had been forgotten...

220
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,700
Nothing ever seems to work out.

221
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,290
Meetings tend to proceed
without any set agenda,

222
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,710
and they can evolve into masked
monsters which add all sorts of hidden costs.

223
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,970
How about we all spread out and search?

224
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,470
This suggestion was clearly not planned out,

225
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,230
so it was immediately shot down.

226
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,460
It's been six hours.

227
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,970
After much discussion, no one has
proposed an alternate course.

228
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,560
The only thing to emerge from the meeting was an irreparable crack

229
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,740
in the community.

230
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,740
The room was filled with gloom...

231
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Then, we'll spread out and search the area.

232
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,010
The very neutral and easy proposal

233
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,510
was immediately accepted by the group.

234
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm about to collapse.

235
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,270
And so...

236
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,100
I have written down the lesson I
garnered from this vital experience

237
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,230
in the form of a title suitable for
a business reference book.

238
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,270
"Never hold meetings.

239
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,230
The outcome is determined
before the meeting begins."

240
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,620
Find any?

241
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,860
Nope, how about on your side?

242
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,240
I don't see anything.

243
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,660
We'll never find a bunch of
chickens that escaped days ago.

244
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,000
Then why are we out here searching?

245
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,470
We must demonstrate that we took action,

246
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,480
even if our actions are meaningless.

247
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Since it was our fault.

248
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,260
I'm hungry...

249
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,260
Mediator, I found one!

250
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
There was a sound in the bushes!

251
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,240
Huh?

252
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,170
Where?

253
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,800
Wh-What is that thing?

254
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,900
It's chicken!

255
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,330
A fully skinned chicken!

256
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,620
Someone caught this chicken and skinned it?

257
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,980
Impossible!

258
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,910
Impossible, indeed.

259
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,380
The image of a real skinned chicken

260
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,290
was immediately replaced with
an extremely surreal image.

261
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,950
Mediator!

262
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,880
We can redeem ourselves by
bringing that back to the village.

263
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Yes.

264
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,820
Absolutely!

265
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,380
That's it...

266
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,140
The skin feels so slimy!

267
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,510
Be strong!

268
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,810
If we work together,

269
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,980
we can catch it!

270
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,140
Whoa!

271
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,140
It got away...

272
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,330
I can't let people know
that my plan failed...

273
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,400
Could I have everyone's attention?

274
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,070
I have an urgent message from the UNCC.

275
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,080
We need you to keep this incident
secret from the other villagers.

276
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,080
Hide the truth.

277
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,040
We don't know who might have been
responsible or what damage may have been done,

278
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,840
and we want to avoid unnecessary confusion.

279
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,840
Manipulate information.

280
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,510
Listen to me...

281
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,970
You can't even tell your families.

282
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,120
That would be considered a leak of
classified information, a punishable offense,

283
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,180
so be very careful!

284
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Use intimidation.

285
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,310
Yes, Mediator!

286
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,060
However,

287
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,620
before the day was out,
the entire village had heard

288
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,820
the legend of the running chicken.

289
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
We'll need to take action on this issue.

290
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,970
I'm very sorry.

291
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,590
Well, I wasn't trying to slack off.

292
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,830
I just wanted to close the case
before anyone else found out.

293
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,870
As for the chicken,

294
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,840
it was seen running around
the plains outside town.

295
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,050
Someone took a picture...

296
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,760
Do you see this?

297
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
What is that?

298
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,140
A burn?

299
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,650
A brand.

300
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,840
Oh...

301
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,150
FairyCo!

302
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,100
That was when the two mysteries became one!

303
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,730
After following the Slate Wall,
a crumbling marker of a former road,

304
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,720
to the point where the wall was
nothing more than rubble,

305
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,330
we discovered the FairyCo factory.

306
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,620
We used Nakata-san,

307
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,510
a fairy pretending to be a doll in our house,

308
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,590
as a compass to guide us there.

309
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,700
Okay, this is FairyCo.

310
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,530
It wasn't all that far away...

311
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,530
When was this constructed?

312
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,450
The construction is very modern.

313
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,520
I think it's more avant-garde than modern.

314
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,970
That's true.

315
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,520
Where's the entrance?

316
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,630
Is that it?

317
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,030
Is my job done?

318
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,010
Yes, thanks.

319
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,120
Oh, that's right.

320
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,280
Pay him his chocolate as promised.

321
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Yes.

322
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,870
Golden sweets...

323
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,870
Literally paid in chocolate.

324
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,500
You have a strange sense of humor.

325
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,130
Well, we've fulfilled our end of
the bargain, so let's get going.

326
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,630
FairyCo Reception Area

327
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,340
Doesn't this place look kind of human?

328
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,890
I agree.

329
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,060
Nothing here was designed by fairies.

330
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,100
What do you think, Nakata-san?

331
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,250
Nothing at all!

332
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,630
He doesn't even care.

333
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,110
Hello, there.

334
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,660
Excuse me.

335
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,390
Welcome to FairyCo.

336
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,110
A-Are you in charge here?

337
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,650
No, I'm just the receptionist.

338
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,120
So what is your business?

339
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,980
We're from the United Nations
Conciliation Commission.

340
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,650
Ah...

341
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,630
We're investigating some unusual
activity at Camphorwood Village.

342
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,410
We've come on an inspection to determine

343
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,630
whether the fairies are responsible.

344
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,220
I understand now...

345
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,880
Because our company is called FairyCo.

346
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,840
It's a logical deduction.

347
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,190
So, the present-humans...

348
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,640
Er, huh?

349
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,270
Um...

350
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,810
This facility has nothing to
do with present-humans?

351
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,860
Correct, this company has a
two-hundred-year history.

352
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,790
Oh...

353
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,950
The population has dropped significantly,

354
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,120
but the economy has managed to survive.

355
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,410
Wh-What was that?!

356
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,780
How dangerous!

357
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,210
Oh, I believe that sound effect is to prevent someone from using this as a hidden camera.

358
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,420
I have no idea what people
were thinking back then...

359
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,890
Oh...

360
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,670
P-Please follow me.

361
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,580
This is our company's famous
marmalade-maker.

362
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,390
There aren't any humans here.

363
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,310
No, everything is automated.

364
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,640
The process is quite fast.

365
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,810
A little too fast...

366
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,320
Yes, that's why it doesn't taste very...

367
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,280
That's the cost of mass production!

368
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,320
If you compare it to something
produced manually...

369
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,280
{\an8}Fair

370
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,280
Oh!

371
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,620
Did you like it?!

372
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,640
No, Assistant has only been
taught three grades...

373
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,120
Excellent, good, and fair.

374
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,580
{\fad(1,888)}Excellent

375
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,580
{\fad(1,888)}Good

376
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,580
{\fad(1,888)}Fair

377
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,580
The idea was to focus on
positive reinforcement.

378
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,380
So fair would be the lowest score?

379
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,560
How do you handle distribution?

380
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,260
Actually, I don't know.

381
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,180
Huh?

382
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,510
I was only assigned here three days ago,

383
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,680
so I'm still learning the processes.

384
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,190
Are you actually able to do your job?

385
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,940
There haven't been any issues.

386
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,180
I just need to stand around,
and I receive food and clothing.

387
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,450
I doubt there's an easier job in the world!

388
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,370
What does this mean?

389
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,400
What, indeed?

390
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,630
The logical explanation would
be that the fairies

391
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,020
restored and operated the factory

392
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,330
in order to provide assistance...

393
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,960
However, the presence of a human
raises a number of questions.

394
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,850
This is the bread factory.

395
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,850
A special robotic guide will provide
an explanation on bread, I think...

396
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,100
You think?

397
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,770
Actually, this is my first
time inside this factory.

398
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,830
Welcome!

399
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,150
My name is Loaf.

400
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,530
This is a robot?

401
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,450
I know everything there is
to know about bread!

402
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,100
U-Um...

403
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,830
What is bread made from?

404
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,020
That's an excellent question...

405
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,710
Bread is made from flour, yeast, and salt.

406
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,870
But these days, you can use
any ingredients you want.

407
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,300
What's important is that it tastes like bread.

408
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,060
Synthetic bread is cheap and healthy.

409
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,600
It belongs on the food honor roll.

410
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,220
So this place is for

411
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,940
synthesizing products that require
difficult to find ingredients...

412
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,250
Well, to be honest, it tastes
far worse than real bread!

413
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,720
You can even synthesize
bread from garbage,

414
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,820
so there were issues...

415
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,160
One incredible remark after another.

416
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,790
Finally, you get to try the bread!

417
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,790
Er, I've lost my appetite...

418
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,710
If you pity my existence, please eat me.

419
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,880
I was also a freshly produced loaf of bread...

420
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,770
Why is the bread bleeding?!

421
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,770
Actually, I'm not a loaf of white bread...

422
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,930
I was a loaf of mixed carrot juice bread...

423
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,080
Recommended for human children
who don't like carrots.

424
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,590
Please help yourself.

425
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,580
No, thank you.

426
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,450
What kind of secrets are
concealed within this factory,

427
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,490
operated by an unknown party?

428
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,270
I would love to leave without
learning the answer,

429
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,850
but I suppose, as a mediator,
it's my duty to solve the mystery...

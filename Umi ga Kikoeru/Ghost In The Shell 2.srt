1
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:20,009
"If our gods and our hopes are nothing but scientific phenomena,
then it must be said that our love is scientific as well"

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,098
Repo-202 calling air traffic control.

3
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,725
We've arrived over the site.
[The kanji means "Look"]

4
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,168
Now starting data-relay.

5
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,807
What's the situation?

6
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:03,347
52 minutes ago, the suspect killed the owner of an apartment.
That's the first murder site. Then, the suspect ran away.

7
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,760
The suspect then killed two cops in this unregistered alley,
which is the second murder site, and is currently hiding there.

8
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,856
We've sealed all the exits and we're
planning on going in in two minutes.

9
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,664
That's a cyborg from Section 9.

10
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,265
Nothing good ever comes
from messing with those guys.

11
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,778
Seems like Denkei wants to get involved.
They're asking for a datalink. [Trans. Note: Denkei is short
for DENnon KEIsatsu which means "Al police".]

12
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,348
First the police, then the Denkei...

13
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,417
Politely ask them to leave.

14
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,543
Help me

15
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,213
Help me

16
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,860
So far there have been
8 homicides by gynoids.

17
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,063
In each case, after killing their owners, the robots
erased their own brains and destroyed themselves.

18
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:31,544
The body in question is made by
Locus Solus Company. Type 2050 Hadaly.

19
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,637
It's a beta mass production
model for evaluation test.

20
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,907
It seems that it was loaned to the
beta testers under contract for free,

21
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,244
but now all the machines
have been recalled.

22
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,585
According to the latest
report submitted to us,

23
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,715
there's no problem either in
the hardware, nor the software.

24
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,228
You got all that?

25
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,909
The new gynoids go out of control without
any known reason, and attack their owners.

26
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,709
The manufacturer recalled these machines in a panic. What's
left is: the usual lawsuit from the victims' families;

27
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:14,616
long civil trials over how much of the responsibility is actually
theirs; and how much compensation they might have to fork over.

28
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,882
I think I understood everything, except
why Section 9 is getting involved in this.

29
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,287
What does it mean, "to understand"?

30
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:24,790
People can't ever know they understand something;
they can only hope that they understand.

31
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,094
Now there are two reasons
for Section 9's intervention:

32
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,059
First, none of the victims' families
have taken any legal action thus far.

33
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,971
They've always opted
to settle out of court.

34
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,011
Second, one of the
victims is a politician,

35
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,639
and one a retired police officer.

36
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,775
As long as there's a possibility
that this may be a terrorist act,

37
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,686
it's our job to determine whether
Section 9 should get involved.

38
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,123
Ishikawa and Azuma are in charge
of investigating the victims.

39
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,889
You two investigate the gynoids.

40
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,727
No questions, just go.

41
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,606
I want to tell you, I did
not volunteer for this job.

42
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,018
I know that I'm not as good as the Major.
[Trans. Note: This is a reference to Motoko Kusanagi]

43
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,018
It's not like that.

44
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,219
They've still got her listed as MIA.

45
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,001
All she ever possessed were
her brain and her ghost anyway.

46
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,870
Even if she doubted
either one ever existed.

47
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,337
Her body and brain just
belonged to the government.

48
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:52,016
Even the classified information in
her memory belonged to the government.

49
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:58,121
All they want is to reclaim her memory,
regardless of whether she's dead or not.

50
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,891
So, where shall we start?

51
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:11,093
Locus Solus is located to the far north, but let's start
our investigation at the precinct, since it's nearby.

52
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:16,903
[The Kanji says "Police"]

53
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:43,926
3014, we have a code 208. 3014, we have a
code 208. Please provide backup for 2033.

54
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,793
It's you...

55
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,800
About the doll this guy
destroyed yesterday...

56
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,671
Two of our young men got killed,

57
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,210
...don't tell me you're
taking over this case.

58
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,706
We're here to decide whether
or not Section 9 will take over.

59
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,254
Forensics is on the right side of
the end of the 19th floor hallway.

60
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,983
Need me to show you the way?

61
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,720
No thanks. It's not
like I'm a tourist here.

62
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,932
An unripe fruit attracts no birds...

63
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,098
...They only come when it becomes sweet.

64
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:44,152
When you were a cop, didn't you also talk back to guys
who came out of nowhere and tried to take over the case?

65
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,457
That's why I lost it. It was
like looking back at a younger me.

66
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:54,096
"What's the point of blaming the mirror
if you don't like what you see."
[Trans. Note: He's quoting Nikolai Vasilevich Gogol.]

67
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,341
"The mirror is not a tool for realizing the
truth, but for obscuring it."
[Trans. Note: He's quoting Ryokuu Saitou.]

68
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,742
Both our faces aren't meant for mirrors.

69
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:50,153
Why do you keep coming back?
I'm not going to cooperate.

70
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,524
I'll have you detained if you persist.

71
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,234
I am Togusa from Section 9 of the
police. This scary looking man here is-

72
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,134
The guy who blasted this
girl with a double-ought buck.

73
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:08,172
If only you had used a.50 caliber hollow
point, we could have recovered the robot easily.

74
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,981
Two of the three victims
were police officers.

75
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,589
She tried to commit suicide
before getting shot...

76
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,582
...didn't she?

77
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,176
What was that about a suicide, uh...?

78
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,211
Halloway.

79
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,409
Miss Halloway, what was
that about a suicide?

80
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:53,587
The gynoids somehow obtained
permission to hurt people.

81
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:59,029
Therefore, they must end their lives as
a result of conflicts with the third law.

82
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,634
"Protect your own existence as long as
such protection does not harm humans."

83
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,570
Technically I think you should
call it self destruction.

84
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,902
If you wish to underline the
difference between human and machines.

85
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,247
Is the self-destruction phenomena
particular to a specific model?

86
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,647
I can't say that's completely correct.

87
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:25,252
These last few years, the number of robot
related incidents have been rising sharply.

88
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,152
Most noticeably in petbot models.

89
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,263
What's the cause?

90
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:40,635
I don't know... Viral or micro organism infection in the nervous
system, man-made mistakes during production, aging parts...

91
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,929
It could be many reasons, but...

92
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,336
But?

93
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:48,970
People throw robots away when
they don't need them anymore.

94
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,483
They keep buying new products
every time a new model comes out.

95
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:58,385
Some of the scrapped ones become vagrant
and they deteriorate without maintenance.

96
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,223
The only thing a robot desires
is to not be disposed of.

97
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,258
No way...

98
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:18,240
When people think "Humans are different from robots", it
is no more profound than thinking "white is not black".

99
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,549
While this may not be the
case for industry robots,

100
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,585
the androids and gynoids as
petbots, at least, were built

101
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,248
free from utilitarianism and pragmatism.

102
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,551
Why are they are human-shaped?

103
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:41,098
Why did they need to be made in
the image of the ideal human body?

104
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,437
I wonder why humans devote so much effort
into making something similar to themselves.

105
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,315
Have you got any kids?

106
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,989
One daughter.

107
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,191
Children stray from the human norms.

108
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:15,289
That is, if you call "human" the thing that has
established self and act according to its mind.

109
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:20,366
What is a child, an initial phase of a human
being who lives without any concept of norms?

110
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:25,307
Obviously the content of a child is different from
that of a human, and yet children are human shaped.

111
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:31,375
The doll a girl uses to play house with is not a substitute
for an actual baby, nor is it a tool for practicing parenting.

112
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,277
The girl is definitely
not practicing parenting.

113
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:41,391
Rather, playing with dolls and
parenting might just be similar.

114
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,757
What are you talking about?

115
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:51,194
In other words, parenting is a quick method to
realize the ancient human dream: to create an android.

116
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,230
Mind you, that's just my opinion.

117
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,399
Kids are... not dolls!

118
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:03,045
Descartes didn't distinguish between humans and
machines or organic world and inorganic world.

119
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,140
When his daughter died at the age of five,
he found a doll that looked just like her.

120
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,220
He named her Francine and doted on her.

121
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,179
There was a story like that.

122
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,054
Why don't we talk about
something more concrete?

123
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:25,363
What can you tell me about that robot
from Locus Solus, the Type 2052 "Hadaly"?

124
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,071
Well...

125
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,341
It's a high quality product.

126
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:35,072
I hear that the body is a mass produced beta version,
but it seems to have received a special configuration.

127
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,544
Special configuration?

128
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,549
It's equipped with some organs that are
not necessary for the maid functions.

129
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,309
What do you mean?

130
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,381
It's a sexdroid.

131
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,787
It's not an option most people want
to publicize, but it's not illegal.

132
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,131
No wonder the families
settled out of court.

133
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,661
The memory is reformatted when
the robot stops functioning.

134
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:04,106
This is a normal procedure by the manufacturer to
protect the technical information of the software.

135
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,307
But...

136
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,774
But what?

137
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,138
A file was left in the sound
buffer. Do you want me to play it?

138
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:31,864
Help me

139
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,273
Thanks a lot.

140
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,746
Hey...

141
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,748
I hesitate to ask such a thing, but...

142
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,151
I have never given birth to
a child, nor raised one...

143
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,255
...and I'm not registered
with an ovum bank.

144
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,564
Thank you very much, Miss...

145
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,467
Halloway. You don't need
to add "Miss" or "Mrs.".

146
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,648
That woman didn't seem
like the technical type.

147
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,288
She's the type who would add her
opinions in the extra info fields.

148
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,481
I used to do that often too.

149
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,557
That's why you didn't get promoted?

150
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,628
Anyways we'll get that gynoid's
brain at Section 9's lab.

151
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,924
We're not gonna see her again, huh?

152
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,495
Is she your type?

153
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,397
To tell you the truth, I happen
to like older women. What's next?

154
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,834
Let's just stick to the routine.

155
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,462
Starting with the shipment inspector?

156
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,509
09 calling 907. We have a 602
at the boathouse in area 201.

157
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,645
Victim is Locus shipment inspector.

158
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,872
Site was secured 2 minutes
after the precinct's arrival.

159
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,216
907 roger.

160
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,841
What good timing.

161
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,319
"Spring day. Taking the carriage back and
forth between this world and hereafter."
[Trans. Note: He's quoting a Haiku by Sonoko Nakamura.]

162
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,703
What? Just you?

163
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,434
Koga brought the stiff to the coroner's after
"re-encountering" his tuna sandwich dinner.

164
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,375
Wuss...

165
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,818
That's the situation 22 minutes ago.

166
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,355
You made the new guys
clean this up?

167
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,863
They gotta learn one day.

168
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,731
Let's go over the situation.

169
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,567
We've identified the victim's brain.

170
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,698
Head of inspection of shipment in Locus
Corporation. Jack Walkerson. 54 years old.

171
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,476
He disappeared after applying
for a leave five days ago.

172
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,878
He rented this boathouse
3 days ago for one week.

173
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,442
Weapons were kitchen equipment.

174
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,425
We investigated vehicles around the site and there was a
parking record for a car whose owner has a criminal record.

175
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,657
We are looking into the possibility of
Bouryokudan involvement.
[Trans. Note: Bouryokudan is the Japanese mafia.]

176
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,333
From a jacket which seems to belong to
the victim, we found seven different cards.

177
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,436
We're trying to pull up
the records for each one.

178
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,652
Well, well...

179
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:45,058
A.38 caliber SW, model 2602.

180
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,793
Seems like he didn't
have the chance to use it.

181
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,329
If it's a gun like that, maybe it
wouldn't have made much difference.

182
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:57,103
Looks like a "cyborg with illegally high output"...
Perhaps a professional impersonating a psycho.

183
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:02,478
969 calling 906. We will arrive in 20
seconds. Hey! What are you doing with th-

184
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,047
I'm not messing it up.

185
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,714
Let's leave the rest to forensics.

186
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,755
907 calling 09. We're
leaving the site to 969.

187
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,819
09 roger.

188
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,091
Today is my daughter's birthday.

189
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,797
You got family, huh?

190
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:22,998
I'll drive you back.

191
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,097
I'm going in the opposite
direction. Ishikawa?

192
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,769
Me too.

193
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,840
A daughter's birthday has priority, huh?

194
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,840
Seems fun here.

195
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,377
It's rare for you to come in person.

196
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,743
I came because parts of
the stiff are missing.

197
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,383
I'll leave it up to you then. Have fun.

198
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,382
Why don't you leave it
up to the local precinct?

199
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,920
The old man is really into this case.
[Trans. Note: Old man = Aramaki, the boss.]

200
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,889
We found it. They're in different
containers in the fridge.

201
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,551
Heart, liver, kidney and pancreas.

202
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,391
What a meticulous bastard...

203
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,950
The fresh type by Inumaru Foods, huh? If you
dry it, it'll last for at least half a year.

204
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,086
You call this food?

205
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,887
I hear you're teaming up with Togusa.

206
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,159
I think it's better than teaming up
with a rookie, fresh out of training.

207
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,936
He's good for a former cop. It's not
like I have any complaints about him.

208
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,440
Well, only the Major
could compare to you.

209
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,978
Hey,
- Ishikawa, you talk too much these days.

210
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,670
See ya.

211
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:14,744
Batou.

212
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,172
What?

213
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,880
Just dry it.

214
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,511
It's a wise choice, considering
the nutrition balance.

215
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,285
The cause of death is the
rupture of cervical vertebrae.

216
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:20,451
The kitchen equipment was not the murder weapon,
but the suspect used it to dissect the body.

217
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,392
You mean the suspect deliberately
cut him up after killing him?

218
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,161
Seems like it.

219
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,322
The organs stored in the fridge
are confirmed to be the victim's.

220
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:34,234
There are early symptoms of gastritis and
cirrhosis. He seems to have been an alcoholic.

221
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,737
What's the reason the
suspect took apart the body?

222
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,810
Could be a sadistic killer, or
someone trying to impersonate one.

223
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,042
He was emphasizing the intent
to punish or extract revenge.

224
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,776
In that case, it's highly unlikely that the suspect
is a professional impersonating a sadistic killer.

225
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,181
What about the twisted doorknob?

226
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,487
According to the analysis, the suspect probably has an
artificial limb similar to the NR26 model made in China.

227
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,091
AKA "Crab Pincers".

228
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,091
That's military grade, isn't it?

229
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,924
You can find inferior
copies on the black market.

230
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,431
It matched with the lacerations
on the neck, by the way.

231
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,227
What about the owner of the
vehicle with the police record?

232
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,273
It was hard to investigate, 'cause it seems that the
owner had it modified at several different shops, so-

233
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,069
Just give us the bottom line.

234
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,773
After cross-referencing with
the nearby parking record,

235
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,281
the vehicle in question is owned by "Koujinkai".
[Trans. Note: Koujinkai is a kind of Bouryokudan.]

236
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,546
Bullet proof... Chassis and
rear dampener were reinforced...

237
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,449
It was seen at the scene of
the crime several times earlier.

238
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,956
This model is popular among cyborgs.

239
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,154
In other words, among thugs with illegal
output ratings. Maybe Yakuza's revenge?

240
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,994
The question is the motive. What
do we know about this "Koujinkai"?

241
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,365
They're an longstanding faction
of the Japanese Bouryokudan.

242
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:42,973
They deal in drugs, prostitution, gambling,
slave trafficking, real estate extortion,
and just about everything else.

243
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:49,537
The boss, Inoue, got his head ripped off by the Hadaly
3 days ago, and now this Wakabayashi guy is taking over.

244
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,848
It's obvious then.

245
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,143
The successor always avenges
the death of the predecessor.

246
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,079
There's just one problem...

247
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:02,323
If the victim was expecting the revenge, then why
did he hide precisely where the Koujinkai lurk?

248
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,853
The data in the brain was erased, so I guess we
have no choice but to investigate the victim further.

249
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,826
Either way, this is the precinct's job.

250
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,829
Could it be terrorists
impersonating out-of-control robots?

251
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:17,204
At this point, there's no political
connection between the victims.

252
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,604
The possibility of terrorism is low.

253
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:25,881
We will transfer full jurisdiction of
the "Hadaly" case to Batou and Togusa.

254
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,181
The rest of you, return to
your regular duties. Dismissed.

255
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,016
Togusa.

256
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,287
Come see me before you leave.

257
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,935
What do you think?

258
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,967
For the time being, we can just investigate the
connection between Koujinkai and Locus Solus.

259
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,476
I mean about Batou.

260
00:31:55,947 --> 00:32:00,043
It's a standard procedure for one to check up
on the psychological tendencies of his partner.

261
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:04,151
But I am neither cyborg,
nor a computer-neurologist.

262
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,986
"One need not have been Caesar in order
to understand Caesar."
[Trans. Note: He's quoting Max Weber.]

263
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:13,089
You have a family, right? Do you
find yourself happy these days?

264
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,424
Yes... I guess...

265
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,626
"Most people are neither as happy
nor as unhappy as they imagine."

266
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,373
"What's important is not to get fed up
with living and lose hope", apparently.

267
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,102
What do you mean?

268
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:31,141
Looking at him these days reminds me
of the Major before she disappeared.

269
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:41,687
"Let one live alone doing no evil, care-free,
like an elephant in the elephant forest."
[Trans. Note: He's quoting Buddha.]

270
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,467
Director, why did you choose me?

271
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,437
Because it was the Major who had
recommended you from the precinct.

272
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,277
What was that about?

273
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,514
"One need not have been Caesar in
order to understand Caesar," he said.

274
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,247
That's true.

275
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:17,417
The world can't afford to live
up to the standard of heroes.

276
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,731
Are you trying to start
a war or something?!

277
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,133
You don't have to become Yakuza
to enter Yakuza's den, but...

278
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,470
...you have to carry a weapon.

279
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,408
Hey, I want to make
sure, before leaving...

280
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,308
Make sure what?

281
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,210
We're just gonna listen
to their story, right?

282
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,180
You don't like Yakuza?

283
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,147
I hate them.

284
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,183
Me too.

285
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,015
Listen to them, that's it, right?

286
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,986
I told you, to enter Yakuza's den...

287
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:51,117
...you don't have to become Yakuza.
But you also said you need a weapon.

288
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,626
I have a family!

289
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,231
I could go alone.

290
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,233
I'm going with you. I'm your
partner. Just promise me.

291
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:02,601
We will just listen to them. We will try
our best not to do any shooting. Satisfied?

292
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,502
Fine.

293
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,404
Then let's go, partner.

294
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,754
What do you want?

295
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,562
I need to talk to that
Wakabayashi guy. Bring him here.

296
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,369
You said you'd try
your best not to shoot.

297
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,744
I did... try my best.

298
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,244
Point man, go. New ones are coming.

299
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,810
Oraa!

300
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,709
An image?

301
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,574
He hacked our eyes?

302
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,590
Blame your second grade brains.

303
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,141
What's up?

304
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,446
Narrow and dark stairs.
How should we do this?

305
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,844
Wait for my signal. I'll go first.

306
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:56,745
I'll go. You're too
big to back up quickly.

307
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,177
Un... n?

308
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,655
Your little gift exploded
right above my head.

309
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,758
Even if they had exploded
with the maximum effect,

310
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,197
there's no way you can kill an
armored cyborg with only 2 grenades.

311
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,630
Are you mocking me?

312
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:57,943
Tell me. Not just about the murder of the head shipment
inspector, but also the connection with Locus Solus.

313
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,490
I was hoping for a good fight.

314
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:24,364
Come on, crab shit. You don't look
that tasty, but I'll give you a shot.

315
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,604
There's no way you could have hit me
with a power move like that, idiot.

316
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:16,483
They said they would tell where the head of
the shipping inspector was so we made a deal.

317
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,421
I just came out of prison after 3 years!

318
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,468
I have no idea what my predecessor
was doing with that company.

319
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,363
Still alive, partner?

320
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,270
I had a vision of my wife and
daughter's face filling my mind...

321
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,644
That's not your wife or daughter.

322
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,547
That's "Death".

323
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,477
I said you two have full jurisdiction,

324
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,455
not that you could enforce the law
without following proper procedure,

325
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:52,460
let alone raid the Yakuza's den.

326
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,427
This is not a jungle.

327
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,830
And you guys are not
Special Force hit men either.

328
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,364
Are you still angry?

329
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,769
I'm not angry.

330
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,811
It's just... I hesitated to say
this after you saved my life...

331
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,675
...but when I team up with you...

332
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,946
...no matter how many lives I
have, it won't be enough, I'm sure.

333
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,955
The full responsibility of the
investigation lies on just the two of us.

334
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,785
We'll get nowhere unless
we take the initiative.

335
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:27,831
If there's any evidence against
Locus Solus, it's up to us to find it.

336
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,794
But did you have to do it guns blazing?

337
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,336
If the old man were really angry,
we would have been fired by now.

338
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,665
Stop here.

339
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,784
See ya.

340
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:19,873
[Trans. Note: The Kanji on the door is "Happy" written
upside down. It's traditional for Chinese stores to have
their Kanjis written upside down on the entrances.]

341
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,491
You stepped into a kill zone.

342
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,232
That right arm, don't perform any
modifications to it by yourself or anything.

343
00:42:53,604 --> 00:43:00,533
There have been reports of newer versions of the
control software conflicting with your copy of the
shooting operation software and causing it malfunction.

344
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,804
In that case, I'll reformat it.

345
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,143
Hey, where's the rest of my original?

346
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,250
Don't do it.

347
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:12,317
The organic material of that
arm is matched with your DNA.

348
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,618
If I use it in, it'll be
just like my original huh?

349
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,224
Ouch! Hold on, damnit!

350
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,305
Since you brought my dog, that means...

351
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,769
We broke into your love nest.

352
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:38,872
When I imagine it crying, or hungry, covered with
shit, waiting for the master who doesn't come back,

353
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,608
I feel bad for the little fella.

354
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,845
I might not look it, but I like dogs.

355
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,113
I'm the one who kept it in
my home for one night, though.

356
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,157
My daughter was so happy and my wife
was pissed 'cause the carpet got dirty.

357
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,786
How long were you watching me?

358
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,327
That doesn't really matter.

359
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,599
It does matter! You
freaking used me as a screen!

360
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,099
You're the sucker who didn't realize it.

361
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,932
If you blame it on someone,
blame it on the old man.

362
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,136
Is it a clone?

363
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,333
Buying an original is expensive, right?

364
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:11,114
This clone comes from the first dog to
be hybridized by artificial insemination.

365
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,784
It's not like you to be
ghosthacked so easily.

366
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:18,180
You let your guard down because
your life became routine.

367
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,289
That's why I told you to dry it.

368
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,783
That's her favorite.

369
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,259
In this neighborhood, I can
get it only in that store.

370
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,161
You were like a puppet,
completely under control.

371
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,823
After shooting yourself
in the arm five times,

372
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,164
You were about to kill
the old man in the store.

373
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,737
Even with your guard down,

374
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,001
There aren't many guys out there
who can hack a brain like yours.

375
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,073
Other than the Major, that is...

376
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,341
Why didn't he just blow
my head off right away?

377
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,745
Because his purpose is not to
eliminate you, but to cause a scandal.

378
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:56,183
You made a raid upon the Bouryokudan's den and you ended up
sending about 10 people to either heaven or to the hospital.

379
00:44:56,293 --> 00:45:01,230
In the same day you started
shooting up a grocery store.

380
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,959
People can't help but think that
you went nuts or your Al went mad.

381
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:10,005
Hey, hold on! You mean this
attack was not just an accident?

382
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,304
If we get out of this now
- The meaning of 9th section existence will be in question.

383
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,004
If she was here, she
would have said that.

384
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,146
A message from the old
man: "Keep investigating."

385
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:22,252
"However, from now on, unless
we find concrete evidence,"

386
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,377
"there's not gonna be any
official support from the team."

387
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,923
We have no choice but
to hit Locus Solus.

388
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,356
"There's no better way to keep the
plan top secret than to act swiftly."

389
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,429
"Fly to the far north
immediately," he says.

390
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:33,354
Just the two of us?

391
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,794
You two are not enough?

392
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,092
No, but... What about the dog?

393
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:42,261
Precisely! It's out of the question to have a dog
with this profession. Even worst, you are single.

394
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,137
Who's gonna take care
of the her if you die?

395
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,041
You guys take care of that damn mutt.

396
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:52,433
This used to be the biggest information
integrating city in the east.

397
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,909
It was in full flourish. That's
Etorofu Economic Special Division.

398
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,810
This huge group of towers is
all that remains of the ruins.

399
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,349
They took advantage of
weak national supremacy

400
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,923
and now it's a nest of multinational corporations
and the criminal organizations they employ.

401
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:11,986
It has become lawless zone, outside of UN
netpolice and ASEAN telecom jurisdiction.

402
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:19,199
"What the individual creates is an expression of the
individual, just as the individual is an expression of
its genes." I remember those words.
[Trans. Note: Paraphrasing Richard Dawkins.]

403
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,971
You mean like a beaver's
dam or spider's nest?

404
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,970
More like a coral reef
that zoanthariae creates.

405
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,135
Well, it's not that beautiful, I guess.

406
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:38,844
If the essence of life is the information that
spreads through genes, society and culture are
also nothing but huge memory systems.

407
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,550
The city is a huge external
memory device after all.

408
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,456
"How great is the sum of them!"

409
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:49,055
"If I should count them, they are
more in number than the sand."

410
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,233
Old Testament, "Psalms",
Chapter 139, huh?

411
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,031
If you can recall words
like that in an instant,

412
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,166
The expression form of your
memory device is probably a bit biased.

413
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,537
You're one to talk.

414
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,577
Sorry for interrupting, but Locus Solus
headquarter building is coming up shortly.

415
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,477
We are detouring just for you
guys, so take a good look at it.

416
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,262
The sight-seeing tour is
over. Now preparing to land.

417
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,931
"Thick as autumnal leaves
that strow the brooks"

418
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,541
"In Vallombrosa, whereth' Etrurian
shades High over-arch'd imbower."

419
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:11,341
Now it's Milton, huh?
But we are not Satan.

420
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,914
Ba... Batou!

421
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,647
You talk big now, huh? Where did you learn to talk
big enough to address me without any -san or -sama?

422
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,556
I haven't forgotten the
favor you did for me!

423
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,460
"I don't have to remember because I never forget,"
huh? [Trans. Note: He's quoting Takao Dayuu.]

424
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,622
Forgive me, Batou... - san!

425
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,325
I'm too good to be addressed with just"
- san" from you.

426
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,336
Please forgive me! I promise
I'll remember this favor forever!

427
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,364
You know this Kim guy, right?

428
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,805
I don't know anyone like that.

429
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:36,742
No, that name is
everywhere in this city.

430
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,644
There's only one Kim I'm looking for.

431
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,217
We need trust in this line of business.

432
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,415
"There's two kinds of trust: Keeping
secrets, and keeping promises."

433
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,718
You can't do both.
Which kind is your trust?

434
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,293
They also say "without
secrets, there is no promise"!

435
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,224
I'll ask it again. You
know the Kim guy, right?

436
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,664
No, I don't know anyone
with such a name...

437
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:08,670
"Life and death come and goes, (Like that of) A puppet
in front of a stage, When the string breaks, (The puppet)
falls apart." [Trans. Note: He's quoting Zeami.]

438
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:12,571
And?

439
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,439
He used to be a long
distance scout for the Army.

440
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:21,915
"If you can't go on top of people, or go below people, you
deserve to fall on the roadside." That's him in a nutshell.

441
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,016
He drifted from special forces
to electronic forces and so on.

442
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,486
Smuggled weapons and contraband, so
he ended up with a bad reputation.

443
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:33,393
In the end, he settled down as hacker,
as is often the case with these types.

444
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,724
"Amazing background", isn't it?

445
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:41,302
"If an ass goes a-traveling,
he'll not come back a horse."

446
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,930
He ruined himself, as I expected from
his personality. He's just an idiot.

447
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,308
Let's go.

448
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,046
[Trans. Note: "Aemaeth"
means "Truth" in Hebrew.]

449
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,249
Batou, he's in the
study on the top floor.

450
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,963
We're too late.

451
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,934
He probably tried to hide
underground somewhere.

452
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,199
He got his brain burnt out
by an offensive firewall.

453
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,103
In any case, he wouldn't
have been much help like this.

454
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:22,020
"As a testament, I rigidly ask you all not to donate any live
flowers, artificial flowers, or 'White Dove Releases'," it says.

455
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,559
Hey!

456
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,861
"When you sleep alone, you never look miserable
like dead body." [Trans. Note: Quoting Confucius.]

457
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,801
Confucius-sama says you should not sleep like a corpse.
[Trans. Note: The "- sama" is supposed to be sarcastic.]

458
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:39,204
I don't have time to deal
with your trashy joke.

459
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,998
Long time no see. Last time we met
was the landing operation in Nemuro.

460
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,862
I'm here on business.

461
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,629
Locus Solus huh?

462
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,637
They entered the market late
as a robot manufacturer, but

463
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:16,040
they expanded the business rapidly after they concentrated
on developing and producing high-class gynoids.

464
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:21,339
Rumor is, they have close ties with politicians, high
level government official, and even criminal organizations.

465
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:33,792
They placed their production line on their
multinational-registered plant ship, anchored off shore, as
they were fearful of the involvement of the authorities,

466
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:37,832
Their dolls are supposed to be pretty good.
[Trans. Note: He's supposed to sound sarcastic.]

467
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:42,333
Good enough to murder and
commit suicide in the end, huh?

468
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,806
If that's true, it's a tactless story.

469
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:04,291
I can't understand people trying to put
a soul into a doll and imitate a human.

470
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,027
If there were such a thing
as a truly beautiful doll,

471
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,064
it would be flesh and
blood without a soul.

472
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:16,238
A corpse at the edges of collapsing, yet
standing precariously at its precipice.

473
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:21,204
Is that the reason to you transformed
yourself into a pure Al?

474
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,370
Humans are inferior to dolls in the
beauty of their appearance and movement.

475
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:28,272
No, even in their existence.

476
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,851
The inomniscient nature
of Human's perception,

477
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:36,254
causes the incompletion of reality...

478
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,851
How complete this species is.
Either they don't have consciousness,

479
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,930
or they acquire the
infinite consciousness.

480
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:46,263
In other words, it can be
realized only in dolls and Gods.

481
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,836
Why don't we talk business now?

482
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,434
No...

483
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:55,242
There's one other existence that
can compare to dolls and Gods.

484
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,411
Animals?

485
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,848
Shelley's lark is...

486
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:05,318
full of deep unconscious joy.

487
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,689
Joy that creatures with strong
self-consciousness like us can never feel.

488
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,920
For the offsprings of those who
devour the fruit of perception,

489
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,356
It's more difficult than becoming God.

490
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,034
They have no choice but to pretend
to be dead by becoming dolls.

491
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,362
Is that why?

492
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,938
"While you do not know life, how can
you know about death?" So says Confucius.

493
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,114
Humans that understand death are rare.

494
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,124
"We usually do not suffer death by choice, but rather by
stupidity and custom." [Trans. Note: Quoting La Rochefoucauld.]

495
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:53,868
In other words humans die
because they can't help dying,

496
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:58,299
but dolls in flesh and blood
live knowing death is a given.

497
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,208
That's the reason Kim chose to turn
himself into a robot completely.

498
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,506
And?

499
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:08,975
After that, he drifted from special
forces to electronic forces and so on.

500
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:13,019
Smuggled weapons and contraband, so
he ended up with a bad reputation.

501
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,818
In the end, he settled down as hacker,
as is often the case with these types.

502
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,789
"Amazing background", it is.

503
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:23,058
"If an ass goes a-traveling,
he'll not come back a..."

504
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,026
What's wrong? Let's go.

505
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,129
[Trans. Note: "Maeth"
means "Death" in Hebrew.]

506
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,231
Batou!

507
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,426
"In this month, today, I
have passed away happily."

508
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,363
"Please advertise this publicly."

509
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:12,972
Hey!

510
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,185
You feel really disgusted, don't you?

511
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,619
I can understand that.

512
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:48,176
The doubt that what looks
alive is actually alive...

513
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,333
Contrarily,

514
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:53,676
the doubt that things
without life might be alive...

515
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,045
The reason why dolls are creepy is...

516
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,348
...that dolls are models of human,

517
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,652
and it means they are
nothing but humans themselves.

518
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:12,056
The fear that humans might merely be the sum
of simple clockwork tricks and substances...

519
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:16,371
In other words the fear of
the phenomena called "human"...

520
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,599
essentially belongs to vanity.

521
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,036
Come on, let's talk business.

522
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,108
The science that tried to explain
the phenomena called "life"

523
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,546
played a role in producing this fear.

524
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,055
The belief that nature
could be calculated leads to

525
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:39,628
the conclusion that humans can
be resolved into simple machinery.

526
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:45,593
"The human body is a machine which winds its own springs.
It is the living image of perpetual movement."
[Trans. Note: He's quoting Julien Offray de La Mettrie.]

527
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,960
The human-machinery theory
of the 18th century...

528
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:53,405
has been revived by the technology of
implanting artificial brains and cyborgs.

529
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:57,205
Since the time when computers made
it possible to externalize the memory,

530
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,407
in order to extend the limits
of their functions as a creature,

531
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:04,744
humans kept actively
machinalizing themselves.

532
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:13,617
It's a sign of the intention to get over the natural
selection of Darwin and try to win the fights of
evolutionary theory on their own.

533
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,631
And it is also the intention to
conquer the nature that created them.

534
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:24,105
The illusion that life is
equipped with complete hardware is

535
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,603
the source of this nightmare itself.

536
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,540
"God... ever... geometrizes..."
[Trans. Note: Quoting Plato.]

537
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:38,610
Let's go.

538
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,036
Batou!

539
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,198
How do you feel?

540
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,398
What happened to me?

541
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,739
That was a virtual experience
maze. You got hacked by the Al.

542
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:16,250
Just as good luck happens three
times, bad luck also gives three signs.

543
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:20,115
You don't see because you don't want to. Even if you realize,
you won't admit it. If someone tells you, you won't listen.

544
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,257
And you and up with catastrophe.

545
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,484
However, in our world, you
don't even get three signs;

546
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,857
If you overlook the first
sign, that's the end.

547
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,721
I told you, I don't have
time for your nonsense.

548
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,667
When did you figure it out?

549
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,629
The one who is trying to
deceive gets easily deceived.

550
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,833
You might have been a
professional ghosthacker,

551
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,408
but too bad for you I'm also a
professional of counter-espionage.

552
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,778
And also, I have a guardian angel.

553
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:52,751
Search the for the record of the hall from that
huge saved data in the external memory device.

554
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,762
In Jacob Grimm's stories,

555
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:06,766
The golem was imbued with life from the
word "aemaeth" written on its forehead;

556
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:10,167
In other words, the word "truth".

557
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,308
but it then had its prefix "AE"
deleted, so now it said "MEATH"

558
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,672
Specifically, it had "death" written on
it, and the golem returned to lifeless clay.

559
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,576
That was the angel's voice saying
there is no truth in this mansion.

560
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,809
You're saying you hacked
through the firewall I built?

561
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,943
No way! No one can do such thing!

562
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:28,587
I told you, it's my guardian angel.

563
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:33,352
Game over, Kim. You've got
a lot of explaining to do.

564
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,634
That's just a doll.

565
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,367
You've become a bad loser, Kim. You
think you can deceive me like that?

566
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:55,814
Batou, how can you be sure that this is not the
continuation of the virtual reality signal I created?

567
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,886
I hear a whisper... in my Ghost.

568
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:04,215
Humans are merely the material from
which the dream called "life" is weaved;

569
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,454
"Dreams"..."Cognition"...
and even "ghosts"...

570
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:12,459
If they were cracks or distortions
in the uniform matrix of reality...

571
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,962
Then I'd also be a useless
empty shell, like you,

572
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,536
but the shoes I'm wearing
are different from yours.

573
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,699
For a bastard who
doesn't believe in ghosts,

574
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:24,835
there's no such thing as
insanity or nervous breakdowns.

575
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:33,888
Your so-called shell will continue to function
physically until the unworthy death comes to you.

576
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:40,284
Ag
- aaahh...

577
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,936
Are you sure we are back
to the physical reality?

578
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:00,674
There's nothing that distinguishes "artificial"
memories from "experienced" memories.

579
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,909
Whichever one this is,

580
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:07,749
you'll only ever realize later on.

581
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,352
It's impossible to know you're in a
dream when you're dreaming. Sucks, huh?

582
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,587
As long as you have Al and allow
external input to write to your memory,

583
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,527
that's the price you have to pay.

584
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:21,299
How can you be sure your wife and daughter
who are waiting in your house actually exist?

585
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:24,303
Maybe you're just a single guy

586
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,568
dreaming, in some
room, of having family.

587
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:31,472
Would you want to wake
up from that dream?

588
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,815
If you knew, why didn't you stop it?!

589
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:36,746
I needed to make sure
Locus had hired Kim.

590
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:39,946
They expected me to come and ask Kim
for a favor, so they set up a trap.

591
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:44,456
Tried to drive me off by putting me through a nightmarish
virtual experience. Probably something like that.

592
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,595
When they screwed me over and
got me to shoot my right arm off,

593
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:50,561
they might have put a branch in my Al.

594
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,432
Like Ishikawa said,

595
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:56,334
there aren't many guys out there
who can do this kind of stuff.

596
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,963
Locus Solus knows that too.

597
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,706
So you expected this from the beginning.

598
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:05,745
I was going to pretend to be
trapped and try to get to Kim's Al,

599
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,349
but that Kim bastard,
he's got some skills.

600
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,847
If there was no sign, I would
have certainly never escaped.

601
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,352
What about the "guardian
angel" you were talking about?

602
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,120
She's gone.

603
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,355
Over the crack of the uniform matrix.

604
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:27,363
Somewhere in the vast net growing
together with its whole domain.

605
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:34,008
If you want to search for evidence that you
exist, there are ways as many as there are ghosts.

606
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,378
For example, you have a daughter.

607
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,376
When we were in the jungle,

608
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,608
Kim would have known this too.

609
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,150
There's only one thing I figured out.

610
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:45,010
What?

611
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:48,385
I'm not good enough to be your partner.

612
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,424
So you want to give up now.

613
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,025
I know I say this many times, but

614
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:54,925
I want to stay alive and
go back to my daughter.

615
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,724
You gotta earn that pay check, though.

616
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,731
What more is there to do?

617
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:03,734
With the data in Kim's Al, we can prove that
Locus Solus is connected to the crime that...

618
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,704
All we have evidence of is
obstructing police investigation,

619
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,401
and violation of Al ethics.

620
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:11,411
Even worst, our
investigation is unofficial.

621
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:18,049
We need material evidence to charge them with
the liability for the gynoids serial murder case.

622
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,553
You say so, but you've broken
the line from Kim's head!

623
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:25,991
It's not broken. His ghost-packed
Al is still connected to Locus Solus.

624
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:30,462
We have to act quickly before
they dispose of all the evidence.

625
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,497
People in the old days
said a good thing like this:

626
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:37,537
"He is my disciple no more. Beat the drum, my little
ones, and attack him: you have my permission."
[Trans. Note: Quoting Confucius.]

627
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:40,107
It's time to ditch the
negotiation and start the violence.

628
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:44,469
Hey, this is different from
our raids on the Yakuzas.

629
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:51,615
I'm not expecting too much from your Mateba.
[Trans. Note: The Mateba is the revolver that Togusa uses.]

630
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:57,716
"Birds hide up high in the sky, and fish hide deep
in the water." [Trans. Note: Quoting Ryokuu Saitou.]

631
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,720
I've made contact with the escort.

632
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:35,830
Roger.

633
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,860
I'm surprised you decided
to dive with that body.

634
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,561
It's very deep around here, so if you
sink, we won't be able to find you.

635
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,071
I used to know this cyborg who dived as a
hobby. [Trans. Note: See Ghost in the Shell 1]

636
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:46,902
And?

637
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,839
I didn't understand her.

638
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,671
I'm doing this for you only
because Lin introduced you.

639
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,941
I hear nobody has come back
alive after going into that ship.

640
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,607
So I don't understand you either.

641
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,515
I know. Keep going.

642
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,178
Hang on tight.

643
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,575
In twelve seconds, I'll be in contact
with the picket radius of the sensor.

644
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,109
I'll run the virtual signal on
the line for only two seconds.

645
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:24,905
Roger.

646
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:29,015
This guy is directly connected
to the security chief's Al.

647
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,311
Initializing synchronization.

648
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,953
I'm in. Give me the ship schematics.

649
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,688
Load completed. Are you on my eyes?

650
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,357
Of course! My great senior is
going in. I've started recording.

651
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,400
Watch and learn, little boy.

652
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:35,766
Intrusion!

653
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,813
Security system restarted on level two.

654
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,745
Probing the whole
facility for Al activity.

655
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:44,909
Searching for the terminal with memory
activity matching the size of the virus.

656
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,146
Searching for incubating
virii at the same time.

657
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:50,088
Linking to the security
chief impossible.

658
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,716
Performing system reboot.

659
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:56,058
System reboot completed.
Security level two initialized.

660
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,325
Setting up detour into the invader.

661
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,230
Rebuilding the firewall.

662
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:02,165
Loading antivirus definitions.

663
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,462
Virus scan in progress.

664
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:09,373
Tracing. Equip decoys.

665
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:13,179
Incubating virus pattern found in the
firewall. They have all become active.

666
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:14,305
Firewall 014 breached.

667
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,883
Firewall 032 error number 280 occurred.

668
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,315
Quarantining infected areas.

669
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,853
Surrounding firewall.
Rebuilding at level one.

670
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,925
Enemy attacking firewall.
Movement pattern identified.

671
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,890
Starting virus transfer.

672
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:31,299
Evacuate! It's too dangerous from
here! You'll get your brain burnt out!

673
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,263
Not yet. I can do a little bit more.

674
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,869
Idiot! Don't be unreasonable.

675
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:15,908
[Trans. Note: This is a repetition
of the "Puppet" poem by Zeami.]

676
01:20:59,087 --> 01:20:59,109
Gynoid's production line.

677
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:02,054
There was irregular input at
the last process of type Hadaly.

678
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,818
Presumed to be unidentified
incubating pattern virus.

679
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:07,394
Deploy all antiviral
tools and inhibit it.

680
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,293
Impossible. The whole fuselage
operation cannot link to the system.

681
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,195
Combat mode body control
program loading in progress.

682
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:16,332
Caution. The body of
THO7 line malfunctioning.

683
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:19,531
Security team, arm yourself and proceed
to the line in question. Repeat...

684
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:06,980
The holy spirit has arrived.

685
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,483
Long time no see, Major.

686
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,542
Or how should I call you now?

687
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:16,256
Technically, only part of me
was loaded through the satellite.

688
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,558
This gynoid Al's memory
capacity is a little cramp.

689
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:23,054
It's already full with just my
combat mode body control system.

690
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,125
So forgive the quality of my
facial expression and voice.

691
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,527
Pass this corridor,
about 50 meters ahead,

692
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,469
there should be an emergency terminal.

693
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:36,441
I'll connect from there and
overwhelm the system all at once.

694
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,117
You haven't changed at all.

695
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:49,054
Go ahead, point man. I will back you up.

696
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,081
Just like old times.

697
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:14,007
"Some look into a mirror
and don't look evil."

698
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:17,013
"It doesn't reflect
evil, but create it."

699
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:20,115
Hey, this is no time
to get all emotional.

700
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:21,244
Not much ammo left.

701
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:26,122
"Namely, you should look down on mirrors;
don't look into it."
[Trans. Note: Continuing the quote from Ryokuu Saitou]

702
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,232
Hey, are you okay?

703
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:15,376
I just have to hold this
ship's control system.

704
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,569
Connect this to the side
terminal on the floor.

705
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:24,310
I'm going to have to shut down physical
control over this body until I finish hacking.

706
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,747
It's entirely up to your.30 caliber.

707
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:31,387
I can handle the shooting, but
there's only 1 extra clip left.

708
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,557
If this turns into hand-to-hand combat, I
can't guarantee I'll be able to hold them off.

709
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,291
I'm going to start.

710
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:43,194
There is irregular connection to
the main system from within the ship.

711
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,362
Within the ship?

712
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,133
Searching for the connection
point. Deploying offensive firewall.

713
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,299
There are multiple virtual
signals from multiple terminals.

714
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:50,570
There is no indication of any Al activity
increasing at any of the terminals.

715
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,612
Searching for all the
external connection points.

716
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,706
Shutting down all the external
connection including our company's line.

717
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,647
Input device outside the
ship physically separated.

718
01:25:57,785 --> 01:25:59,480
No response from
emergency control system.

719
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:01,145
Remote initialization impossible.

720
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,224
Virus integration and spreading
mode in progress in each section.

721
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,349
Core system firewall breached.

722
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,222
Preparing for system reboot.

723
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:08,727
Data quarantine started at level one.

724
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,195
Many irregular connection
found in the core system.

725
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,323
Response speed is not keeping up.

726
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:30,509
I've overwhelmed them. I closed
down all the external connections.

727
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,772
This ship is in stand-alone mode.

728
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:38,747
It's moving?

729
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:44,925
This ship is heading towards the nearest country
where we'll have jurisdiction to prosecute.

730
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:49,727
This ship itself is the evidence
we need to prove Locus Solus' crime.

731
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,263
What if Locus tries
to recapture the ship?

732
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,867
A convoy will show up to escort it.

733
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,765
I have already contacted naval support.

734
01:27:55,870 --> 01:28:01,365
Meanwhile, why don't we go take a look at the secret
behind Locus Solus' ability to imbue their dolls with soul?

735
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,306
You already know the secret, don't you?

736
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:08,615
You have some idea too, right?

737
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:30,029
There's no noise. Are they shielding
from electromagnetic radiation?

738
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,852
Ghost dubbing.

739
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,820
By experimenting on animals, they've discovered
that they can make a poor quality mass-copy,

740
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:54,621
but the original brain gets destroyed in
the process, so this technology was banned.

741
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:59,332
They brainwash the children
smuggled by the Koujinkai,

742
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,834
and dub their ghosts
into the gynoids' bodies.

743
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:07,402
No wonder Locus Solus'
gynoids were so lifelike.

744
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:14,437
Help me

745
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:29,488
Help me

746
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:15,466
You came to help me.
Mr. Walkerson said so.

747
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:19,511
He said that people from the police
will come. That they would help me.

748
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:24,443
I am at my 4th dubbing, but Sowana
who came with me is at her 5th.

749
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:28,418
She doesn't hear anything and
she doesn't answer anymore.

750
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:39,390
The head of inspector who got killed changed the
ethics code programming for these kids. When Locus
found out, they had him killed, under the pretence
of predecessor's revenge. That's my theory.

751
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:46,136
He said if the robots create some
accidents, then somebody will notice.

752
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:48,938
That someone will come help us.

753
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:53,440
Don't you realize what kind
of chaos you have caused?

754
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:58,582
I'm not talking about
just about the humans...

755
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:03,890
Didn't you think about the dolls who were forced
to have malicious ghosts dubbed into them?!

756
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:11,488
B-But... But...

757
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,502
I didn't want to become a doll!

758
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:26,806
"You cry for bird's blood,
but not for fish's blood."

759
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,547
"Fortunate for ones with voice."

760
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,119
If the dolls also had voices,

761
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:35,780
they would have screamed
"I didn't want to become human!"

762
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:40,824
Let me ask you something. Do
you think you're happy now?

763
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,457
Well... I'm feeling nostalgic...

764
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:46,658
At least I am at peace at this point.

765
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:56,141
"Let one live alone doing no evil, care-free,"
[Trans. Note: Quoting Buddha]

766
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,945
"like an elephant in the elephant forest."
[Trans. Note: Quoting Buddha]

767
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:02,950
Batou, remember.

768
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,916
When you access the net,

769
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,984
I will always be besides you.

770
01:32:14,061 --> 01:32:15,153
I'm gonna go now.

771
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,073
She showed up in that ship, right?

772
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:01,572
Your guardian angel.

773
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:06,907
Silence again, huh? Do you think I'm
gonna write that down in the report?

774
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:09,573
I'll come pick you up
tomorrow at 0820 hours.

775
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:12,744
I will have to thank you
for taking care of her also.

776
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,714
Why don't you come in, if you want?

777
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:21,090
I have no interest in intruding
in other people's family occasions.

778
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:23,660
Papa!

779
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,565
Hey, a souvenir! A souvenir?

780
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:28,827
I didn't forget.

781
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:29,935
Yay!

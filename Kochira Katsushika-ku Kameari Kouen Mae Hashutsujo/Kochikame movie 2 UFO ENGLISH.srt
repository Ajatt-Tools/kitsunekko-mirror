(Naoko) Haunt The joint party during

5
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:35,189
Huh.

Do you really do it to seniors?
Obviously.

20
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:27,175
Recently, UFO sightings have
been increasing around here

21
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,343
You know you, right?

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,346
It's hard to
miss this business opportunity .

23
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:35,183
But if you find out ...

24

What if Katsushika becomes a tourist attraction

25

It's decided that everyone will be overjoyed
.

Just like always, take a
piggyback ride .

If this really
makes it appear in UFO ...

If you don't get tired unexpectedly,
huh ...

79

By the way, I
think I will serve the customers .

(Ohara) Wait here.

85
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,294
What are you doing here?

86
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:09,797
I was
asked to do that ...

87
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:13,801
Who asked me?
(Honda) That is ...

88
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:17,471
The idiot who thinks about
such a thing is decided by him.

89
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,672
Hehehehehe'
Yeah?

Isn't it?
Wow! My money! Hmm?

98
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,174
Uuu….

I'm Andromeda
Karakita ...

Oh my!
(Ohara) Wait, Ryotsu!

102
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:10,958
Did you wait!
For regional activation of Katsushika ...

103
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,129
No, it's the manager ...
(Ohara) Noisy.

104
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,798
Help me!
Wait, wait! ➡

105
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,800
Uhhh ...
Wow.

Uwahaha ~.
Cor ...

107
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:27,005
Hey! Ryotsu!

108
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,811
Huh ...

109
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:34,482
Huh,
it ’s okay if you come here.

110
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:38,152
Huh ... oh shit
, Katsushika

111
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:41,155
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I thought it could be a UFO attraction .</font>

112
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:45,159
Ah, I get tired of losing my bones
.

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,162
Chiku show!

114
00:06:48,163 --> 00:07:05,663
♬～

115
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,786
It will be a trip to
the police station next week.

116
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,954
Certainly it was Hawaii this year.

117
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:16,290
If you ’
re the director of Ohara

118
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,959
Sooo
What I've liked.

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,963
Nakagawa and Reiko are
nice because Hawaii is like a garden

120
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:27,635
It's my first time ... so
are you both?

121
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:32,306
I went to Hawaii many times
when I was a kid, on the Joban Line.

122
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:33,974
Joban Line?

123
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:37,144
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Isn't it "Joban Hawaiian Center" ?</font>

124
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,146
Isn't it similar?

125
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:43,150
Anyway, Hawaii
is full of Japanese people.

126
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:46,751
By the
way, I'm always in Hawaii.

127
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:50,991
that person?
Oh yeah.

128
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:54,662
Ryuhei Tanaka is
a friend of elementary school.

129
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:58,165
Ryuhei, unlike me,
was able to study.

130
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,603
But for some reason I got
along with me and often played together

131
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:06,607
When the 3rd summer vacation is over and the
new semester begins

132
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:09,276
I was transferred to Hawaii.

133
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:12,446
Did you study abroad?
Hmm no.

134
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:15,449
My
parents died in a typhoon accident .

135
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,619
Well.
(Terai) But why in Hawaii?

136
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,789
It seems that your uncle was
running a barber shop over there.

137
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,190
What are you doing now?

138
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:29,130
Ryuhei's radio-controlled UFO was
really amazing.

139
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:31,966
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Lightly flew from Asakusa to Ueno</font>

140
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,635
I was
mistaken for a real UFO

141
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,971
It was a fuss.

142
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:42,309
Hmm? That's right
. If you ask him, it looks like a real UFO ...

143
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,313
This time I can make a
lot of money .

144
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:49,316
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Ryo- chan, are n't you planning something again?</font>

145
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:52,153
It's urse!
To go to hawaii

146
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:54,321
What do you do not have much fun?

147
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:58,492
The trip with the director
was always cramped.

148
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:01,193
«(Ohara) Do bad cramped.
Say!

149
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,265
Uhhh ...

150
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,267
No, the manager!

151
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,768
(Terai / Nakagawa / Reiko)
Good morning.

152
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,938
Good morning
Ryotsu No need to worry.

153
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,439
Heh?

154
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,609
You don't have to go to Hawaii
.

155
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,612
Ehhh!

156
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:22,116
If we all go on a trip, the police station
will be empty.

157
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:26,453
Eh, did you come to Sakonji
Temple and Volvo last year ?

158
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:29,790
No, it
's a punishment for UFO noise during this period.

159
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:34,128
That's why if
you think of Katsushika town ...

160
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,963
Don't say no!

161
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:39,967
Director!
Please take me without saying such a thing .

162
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,968
Minister ~!

163
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,812
See Ryotsu.

164
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:57,484
Uh oh
what is this luggage.

165
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:01,655
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> A souvenir
for those who took care of their family trip .</font>

166
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:06,160
Don't
take any souvenirs with me, too.

167
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,997
That's why I brought
you to Narita.

168
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:14,335
Well, it's not such an "Ultra Quiz"
.

169
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:16,003
I'm not self-employed.

170
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,339
I will definitely
buy a souvenir .

171
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,841
Let's go.
(Terai) I 'm worried. ➡

172
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:24,011
It's my first time abroad.
Oh wait!

173
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:27,514
When this happens,
I will definitely go to Hawaii.

174
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:31,715
Ryupyo will make a UFO and make a
big profit.

175
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:35,856
Ryotsu Me with souvenir

176
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:38,692
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Where on earth did you go ?</font>

177
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:41,695
Director, it's about boarding time.

178
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:44,865
You must give up on souvenirs,
right?

179
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:48,066
Wow, it's a
really useful guy.

180
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,039

(Staff) Oh? Hmm?

184
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:10,157
Ugh ... baboon ...

185
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:13,458
It's a free
trick to go to Hawaii ...

186
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:19,031
It's ugly.

187
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,506
(Staff 1) Uh ...

188
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:29,343
(Powerful voice)

189
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:30,844
(Staff 2) Oh!

190
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,516
Upside down.

Wow! Damn.

194

Okay, I
've escaped Japan . The rest is military funds.

195

196
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:29,502
Huh.

197
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,005
Hehehe.

198
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:36,510
Well everyone.

199
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:39,346
Tokyo's famous thunder storm
"Iseya"

200
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,682
How about Dorayaki?
(Ohara) Oh?

206
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:02,469
I was saved. I just left
a souvenir at the airport .

207
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,807
The number of
such stupid customers is increasing recently .

208
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:08,809
Ah?
Uhufufufu ...

209
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,477
Oh, let's get it all.

210
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:14,648
If the Japanese yen is 100,000 yen,
it will be 1,500 dollars.

211
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,152
Well
, I bought it at half the price.

212
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:21,822
Customer This is no longer
Japan

213

Customs duty and resident tax
will be incurred.

214
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:28,328
Resident tax !?
(Terai) I don't know.

215
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,166
Oh yeah,
it's $ 1,500.

216
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,834
Every time!
Ah.

Excuse me.

223

Ah ... it was a dangerous place
.

224
00:13:57,358 --> 00:14:01,628
But now I 'm getting $ 1,500 .
The manager is a bit messy.

225
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:04,131
≪ (Ohara)
That stewardess. Uh.

226

(Woman 2) Hmm.
(Terai) Oh oh ho ho ho ...

242
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,457
It's the first time I was kissed
by someone other than my wife .

243
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,628
Aloha Katsushika police staff.

guide?
(Terai) Wow, it doesn't help.

247
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,304
You don't need it.

248
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:20,474
It's better to ignore the manager
.

249
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,975
That's right.

250
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:25,979
Oh Aloha Aloha.

251
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,148
A commemorative photo was made.
(Ohara Terai) Eh?

252
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:29,649
You see.

253
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:35,322
Ah!
(Terai) It's embarrassing, this picture.

254
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,991
Uh ... before I knew it.

255
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:40,327

If you can't buy it here</font>

256
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:44,665
I will send it as a postcard to the
Katsushika station with my Japanese family .

257
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,334
Uhufufu ...
Stop it. ➡

258
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:51,672
It would be
misunderstood if such a photo was sent .

259
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:53,840
Heaven.
There is no choice .

260
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,241
$ 5 is cheap at tourist spots.

261
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:00,347
Go ... $ 500 !?

262
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:03,283
I
can't return what I got once .

You
can go see Ryuhei with this.

268
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:24,805
If
you're clumsy, you'll only pay money.

269
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,640
It's going to be early.

270
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:30,310
Uhh baboon ...

271

Pearl Harbor Trevi Fountain at
Cape Koibito.

I didn't see it in the guidebook .</font>

276
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:49,496
Such an old guidebook is
useless.

277
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:52,833
The latest English guidebook for
$ 1,000.

278
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,168
But I speak English ...

279

A little Fujiyama.

it is a scammer who makes tourists duck.

nagging manager.

292
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:38,645
Wow!
(Guide) This is it.

293
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:43,150
Wow,
it hurts ... it hurts ... oh !

294
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,652
Wait, wait!

295
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:48,953

That guy, catch it!
Ugh.

300

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,937
eh?

314
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:13,938
Sorry put me.
Ha ha?

315
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,942
Oh wait a minute!

316
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,945
Ugh! Wow ...

317
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:25,619
It ’s dangerous,
uncle.

318
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,290
Uwashi is
chasing Ryotsu from Japan.

319
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,792
I'm not chasing you

320
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:34,127
Are you chasing you?
eh….

321
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:36,630
There are
'm Hawaiian mafia.

322
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,465
Ugh.

323
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:41,134
Ah, please fly!

324
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:43,235
Good hold
on.

325
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,740
No!

326
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,246
Wow!

327
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:58,316
It's not a circus!

328
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,991
Ugh ... good.

329
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:09,830
It 's a thrilling thing
to be chased by a police car .

330
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:11,498
I wanted to try it once.

331
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:14,501
Huh
huh ... huh huh ... that was good.

332
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:18,171
Uncle,
wasn't it really a bank robbery ?

333
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:21,842
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I 'll say no.
I 'm a Japanese police officer</font>

334
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,844
Ryotsu Kankichi, Chief of Police.

335
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:27,681
Okay, I understand. I'll
do something like that.

336
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,182
Uhhh.

337
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:34,020
so? Where do you want to go
Hmm ... yes.

338
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,691
In any case, go to the town
of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii .

339
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,693
Hiro?
Is it impossible?

340
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,529
No, it was just right.

341
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,830
Hiro is the town where I was born.

342
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:52,372
Name is?
Mina.

343
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,541
Uncle is Japanese.
Ah.

344
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,877
My dad is also Japanese.

345
00:20:56,878 --> 00:21:00,547
Yoisho
I came so? Well in Japan?

346
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:03,316
Naiwa.
I nice place.

347
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:06,319
Please take me to my dad next time.
No.

348
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,822
Daddy
died before I was born .

349
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:10,323
eh….

350
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:12,993
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I only know my dad from the photos.</font>

351
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:16,329
Mom also
died when I was in kindergarten ...

352
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,165
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Seems like it was bad.</font>

353
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,003
No, it's easier to have no parents
.

354
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:25,171
You can fly the sky freely.

355
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,173
I'm not a bank robber though.

356
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:30,674
I
'm telling you I'm not a robber.

357
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:39,185
Hey, is this the city of Hilo?

358
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:42,188
Unlike Honolulu, it's
calm and nice.

359
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:45,689
It used to be the second largest
town in Hawaii .

360
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:50,295
Here 'Hilo Airport.
N?

361
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,535
It's a dangerous police car.

362
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:58,371
Mina I
'm sorry, but let me down here.

363
00:21:58,372 --> 00:21:59,872
here?

364
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:05,812
Oh, a taxi just came.

365
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,213
Mina, get closer.

366
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:15,655
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Isn't it a cam taxi?</font>

367
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:19,826
Mina I
'm taken care of. Will you really get off here?

368
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,829
Ah.
See you robber.

369
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,664
Wow.

370
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:26,833
Wow!

371
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,335
Well.
( CamCam Naito) Oh!

372
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:31,671
(Sudden braking sound)
Waa' Uu'.

373
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:34,507
Itte!

374
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:37,808
So I
'd say I'm not a robber !

375
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:45,551
(CamCam) It's good.

376
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,188
Ah ...

377
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,690
Do you know Tanaka barbershop?

378
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:53,360
Ah, do you
know Mr. Lucky ?

379
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:56,061
Yup? Lucky?

380
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:11,144
(Lucky Tanaka)
Hoo Ryuhei's childhood friend.

381
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:15,648
I am Ryotsu Kankichi, who was in Asakusa
until the 3rd grade of elementary school .

382
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:18,151
From Japan, bother.
Yes.

383
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,653
Ryuhei to UFO ...
oh no.

384
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:23,823
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I
came here for a little sightseeing in Honolulu.</font>

385
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:27,160
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I'm sorry I came all the way</font>

386
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:30,163
Ryuhei
died 15 years ago .

387
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:31,664
Huh !?

388
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,835
(Lucky) That
's the last picture of Ryuhei.

389
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:40,340
It's Ryupei, yes,
I still have the vestige of my childhood.

390
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:44,344
Huh, that's too bad.

391
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:48,181
You
can only see Ryuhei as an adult only in photos.

392
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:53,686
Ryuhei married Kathy, a classmate
at the University of Hawaii,

393
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:57,023
Please call on NASA immediately.
NASA?

394
00:23:57,024 --> 00:23:59,692
What
was your job like?

395
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:03,296
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I don't
really understand it because it is confidential .</font>

396
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:06,633
Ah, please have coffee
.

397
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:09,824
(Lucky) Apparently he
died in an accident during his research .

398
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,240
(laughter)

399
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,651
Shortly after Ryuhei went to NASA,
Cathy gave birth to a daughter.

400
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,986
Ryuhei didn't even know that ...

401
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,489
eh? Ryuhei and daughter?

402
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,790
(Lucky)
Oh, there's a photo next to it.➡

403
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:35,829
Kathy also
died of illness, but ➡

404
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,665
My daughter Mina
grew up well.

405
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,501
Ah !? Is this a Mina?

406
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:44,003
I
just got on this Cessna .

407
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:49,008
That's right Mina is
run by my friend Happy Tonoyama

408
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,344
I work for an airline.

409
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:54,013
Happy Tonoyama ...
Ryotsu-san.

410
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:56,516
eh?
If you like

411
00:24:56,517 --> 00:25:00,353
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> Would you
please tell me the story of your childhood in Ryuhei ?</font>

412
00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:01,788
Oh ...

413
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:04,789
(Lucky)
I'm sure you'll be happy.

414
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,793

♬～

418
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:33,486
I'm enjoying it. Manager and Terai-san.

419
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:36,656
I'm glad
it was a comfort trip.

420
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:39,247
(Helicopter rotor sound)
(Reiko Nakagawa) What?

421
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:49,836
It looks like a low altitude
flight, not a tourist helicopter.

422
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:52,338
Maybe paparazzi.
Hollywood star

423
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:57,869
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
You're sneaking up at a hotel somewhere, right?</font>

424
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:03,414
Ah….

425
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:07,752
Hello Do not you have someone?

426
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,456
Wow!

427
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:16,462
Ze ... Zero fight!
Besides, it's not type 21.

428
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:18,965
I also
made a plastic model, but ...

429
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:20,466
It ’s good.

430
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:24,137
This is a
replica that looks just like the real thing .

431
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:27,307
Wow!
Okay ...

432
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:28,808
It's ugly.

433
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:33,146
You are Ryotsu or
I am Happy Tonoyama.

434
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:35,315
Lucky to hear the story.

435
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:38,151
Don't be surprised.

436
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:41,321
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I was wondering
if I had even replicated the Pacific spirits .</font>

437
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:43,323
(Happy) Uhahahaha.

438
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:45,992
But this is
not a replica.

439
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:49,662
It's forgotten by the Japanese military
. Is it real!

440
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:51,998
Did you fly? this.

441
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,335
Of course
, it has been properly maintained.

442
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:57,503
Hmm.
How about?

443
00:26:57,504 --> 00:27:00,773
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Would you like to fly to Pearl Harbor ?</font>

444
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:03,109
Oh please refrain.

445
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,279
Rather, I
came to see Mina.

446
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,115
It was a mistake. With
Mina

447
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:11,784
I
went to prepare for the dinner show .

448
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:16,456
Dinner show?
Ah, I'm leaving from Pier 8 tonight

449
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:21,628
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> You can
listen to Mina's song if you join a sunset cruise .</font>

450
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:32,472
♬～

451
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:36,809
Hmmm I
thought it was something like a sunset cruise

452
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,010
In short, it's a
houseboat banquet.

453
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:43,816
Ya.
(Waiter) Oh customer.

454
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:46,986
With that kind of clothes ...
Ah.

455
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:51,287
After all, the
scale is different from that of a houseboat .

456
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:56,496
Get manager!
Why are you here?

457
00:27:56,497 --> 00:28:00,333
The guidebook is also 5 stars
.

458
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:02,602
It has a nice atmosphere.

459
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:05,438
Oh, it ’s
really nice to come to Hawaii .

460
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:08,608
Ryotsu also I missed you.
Say!

461
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,944
Director.
(Ohara) Oh oh no.

462
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:16,115
There is no Ryotsu, so I
can enjoy my next trip with peace of mind.

463
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:17,950
Fufufu'.
(Reiko) Ufufu'.

464
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:20,119
When it comes to trouble,
that Fujiyama

465
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,622
It's only a scammer.
(Ohara) Right.

466
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:25,958
Fujiyama, but
if you have reported the damage

467
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,961
It
seems that the Honolulu Police wanted this.

468
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:32,662
Kussok
department manager It's superfluous.

472
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:54,821
This is Naito.

473
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:58,157
I am "Lucky Tanaka and
Happy Come Come" .

474
00:28:58,158 --> 00:29:00,927
(Applause)
Ah, lucky and happy.

475
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:03,628
Besides,
I'm not a taxi driver.

476
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:11,604
Aloha Good evening everyone is
Mina.

477
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:14,607

♬ I looked up at the stars in the night sky

483
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,467
Isn't it a good voice?

484
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:45,198
After all, it was the correct answer
without bringing Ryotsu or anything .

485
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,146
♬ Is it really far away?

486
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:57,150
It
would be great if Ryuhei lived.

487
00:29:57,151 --> 00:30:00,820
♬ Like a wave
?

488
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:03,656

00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,019
Ryuhei!
(Ryuhei Tanaka) Right?

495
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,190
Isn't it Ryupei?
I'm Ryotsu Kankichi.

496
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:39,859
Kankichi.
Was Ryuhei alive?

497
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,560
♬ Missin' you

498
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,231
(Ryotsu / Ryuhei) Right?

499
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,869
Ah
! Oh wait!

500
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,372
Why do you run away?
(Ryotsu / Ryuhei) Oh!

501
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,073
What ?!

502
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:01,314
(Noisy)

503
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:03,649
(Nakagawa) Ah ...
(Ohara) What's going on?

504
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,819
I
didn't write it in such an attraction guidebook.

505
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:17,663
♬～

506
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,264
Oh Ryuhei!

507
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:23,503
(Subordinate 1) Oh!
What!?

508
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:25,505
Kya!
(Happy) Mina!

509
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:27,306
Ryuhei!
Ryuhei?

510
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:33,074
(Nakagawa) Uh ...
(Scared voice of customers)

511
00:31:38,852 --> 00:31:41,187
Ugh! Eh.
(Subordinate 2) Oops.

512
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:43,689
Hi!
(Subordinates) Uh.

513
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,191
(Gunshot)

514
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:47,193
(scream)

515
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:49,362
Ugh.

516
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:50,863
Ah!

517
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:56,702
(Tiger)
Hook.

518
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,204
(Subordinate 2) Oh shit.

519
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:00,206
Go!
(Subordinate 2) No!

520
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:02,975
Get it!
Oh ...

521
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:05,645
Hey eh?

522
00:32:05,646 --> 00:32:09,148
No! Hand grenade
and the pin is missing!

523
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:12,249
(Subordinates) Eh!
I don't know.

524
00:32:15,322 --> 00:32:17,657
(Explosive sound)

525
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:19,659
(All) Oh!
(Terai) It's an explosion!

526
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,760
Evacuate to here soon.
(Ohara) Ah.

527
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:26,497
What about Mina?
(CamCam Happy) Eh?

528
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:30,002
(Male) Eiuuuuuu.

529
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:32,004
Haha ... Ryuhei!

530
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,805
Ah!

531
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,843
You guys!
What are you going to do with Ryuhei!

532
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:39,345
Kankichi!

533
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,846
(Gunshot)

534
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:43,349
Do it! Oh ~

535
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,850
Go ahead.
(Subordinates) Yes.

536
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:47,687
Kankichi Hiryumaru is about to rampage.

537
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,188
Hiryuumaru?

538
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:54,026
I
'll let you escape .

539
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:57,363
wait!
Ah Mina!

540
00:32:57,364 --> 00:33:01,764
Uhhhhh!
Kya!

541
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:08,474
What an idiot are you thinking?

542
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:10,810
Hey, what is Ryuhei?
Ugh.

543
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:15,648
Maybe Ryuhei ... is
that my dad?

544
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:19,819
Yes, Ryuhei is alive
, not dead.

545
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,154
After all ...
What about your uncle?

546
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:25,655
I am
Ryohei, a childhood friend of Ryohei.

547
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:30,496
Daddy ... Daddy is alive
!

548
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:33,666
Ugh.
Uwaa'.

549
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,267
Kya!
Wow!

550
00:33:42,676 --> 00:33:46,345
Phak soak.

551
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:50,182
What on earth is that?
Where was your dad taken?

552
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:52,184
Wakaran even eagle.
He is

553
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:55,187
I just
said, "Hiryumaru starts rampaging."

554
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:56,689
Hiryuumaru?

555
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,692
《Kankichi Hiryumaru will be rampaging.》

556
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:02,294
It is written that a dragon flies, "Hiryumaru."

557
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,130
Ryuhei made it as a child

558
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:06,966
It's the
name I gave to the radio control UFO .

559
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,468
UFO? Radio controlled?

560
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,138
But
what does that mean?

561
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,974
(Helicopter rotor sound)

562
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:16,809
Honolulu Police.

563
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,646
Anyway,
let's not rescue Ryuhei .

564
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,648
It does not matter.
Oh?

565
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:25,818
I 'm saying that it doesn't
matter if you say dad now .

566
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,319
Mina.

567
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,156
Because
I was told that daddy was dead.

568
00:34:30,157 --> 00:34:33,993
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I've
never been taken care of and celebrated my birthday .</font>

569
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:37,163
There
must have been some circumstances in Ryuhei .

570
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:39,999
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Have you left it alone for 15 years now?</font>

571
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,300
And you want to see Ryuhei, and you have
such a dangerous mane.

572
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:47,006
Mon different
Sonnanja Neyo!

573
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:49,008
(Speaker: Duke Todo) This is
Honolulu Police.➡

574
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:51,010
Please rest assured.

575
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:53,679
Don't be mean!
I'm not stubborn!

576
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,183
Mina!
I've been living alone all the time.

577
00:34:57,184 --> 00:35:00,953
That's why.
I don't need daddy anymore.

578
00:35:00,954 --> 00:35:04,457
That
's the only father I have.

579
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,958
I didn't know.

580
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:09,128
Ryuhei
came all the way to see you.

581
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:11,130
Then why
didn't you ever come?

582
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:15,468
So something happened
. It doesn't matter to me.

583
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:19,472
It
may be only your daughter that can help Ryuhei .

584
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:22,308
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
You may be the only one in the world !</font>

585
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:24,477
Ha!

586
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:27,146
I'm sorry for importing

587
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:29,982
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> Are
you witnessing the criminal who sank the ship ?</font>

588
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:31,650
That's ...
this person.

589
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,487
eh?
This person is the culprit.

590
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:36,155
what!?

591
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:39,992
But ... no, Mina,
tell me it's a joke.

592
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:44,493
Oh,
it's a sin, please help me!

593
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,668
What? Was Fujiyama arrested?
(Terai) Right?

594
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:51,837
It
seems they were floating in the sea

595
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,340
Seems to be the
criminal who sank the ship .

596
00:35:54,341 --> 00:35:56,842
what?
(Terai) The ship was sunk ➡

597
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:59,345
Are they different?

598
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:02,782
So
I want Director Ohara to become an underwriter.

599
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:05,618
That's right.
(Ohara) Don't say Bubbaka.

600
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:07,286
I'm a victim.

601
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:09,455
Why
are you ... ?

602
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:12,958
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I'm not the one who sank the ship !</font>

603
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,628
Ah, please help me!

604
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:18,631
Both!
(Ohara) Ryotsu Ryotsu ...

605
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:21,634
Fujiyama
was really a senior.

606
00:36:21,635 --> 00:36:23,636
Don't be surprised

607
00:36:23,637 --> 00:36:27,139
Director!
Mr. Ohara.

608
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,309
You
say that Fujiyama is your acquaintance .

609
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,645
I
don't know any scammers .

610
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:34,146
That's right!

611
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:37,316
Okay
then.

612
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:41,654
Director cold!
The town of Kameari where we walked together

613
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:44,655
Did you forget it?
Eh!

614
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:48,327
Is it all right?
(Ohara) That guy ➡

615
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:52,328
It would be a shame for the Japanese
police to be known as a police officer .

616
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:58,504
Why did you lie?
Daddy was dead.

617
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,940
I wasn't lying.

618
00:37:00,941 --> 00:37:04,109
I ’m Cathy,
Ryuhei ’s really

619
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,945
I thought it was dead.

620
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:09,281
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
So daddy was tricking everyone?</font>

621
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:12,451
It's a trick or
something ... it 's not.

622
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:16,288
Mina Actually, yesterday
someone went to Kathy's grave

623
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:19,625
I went equipped with a flower.
Eh?

624
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:22,628
It must be Ryuhei.➡

625
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:25,297
There was something
wrong with him.

626
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:28,298

Hey you?

638
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:11,277
(Volvo) Ryotsu's guy suddenly asked
for an answering machine and went to Hawaii

639
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:14,280
Obviously
you'll probably buy souvenirs .

640

Hawaii souvenirs ...

641
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:19,952
Macadamia
nuts are probably Hawaiian .

642
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:22,288
What are you talking about in
Hawaii

643

It's Agnes Lamb.
(Volvo) What is that?

644
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,192
The Will also known Agnes Lum

(Television: Announcer) It seems that
a UFO-like object appeared in Tokyo.➡

Why
did you lie that you died ?

754
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:26,144
eh?
Depending on the answer

755
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:29,147
I have to hit about one shot before
I feel like it .

756
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:31,149
I'll leave this to go to Japan.
Eh?

757

(Terai / Ohara) Oh.
(Nakagawa) Excuse me.

759

(Terai) As expected, Nakagawa Konzern A
private plane is also a jumbo jet.

Okay, that's
good.

762

Then what should I call?
Ah.

769
00:46:10,957 --> 00:46:14,459
Kameari:
Don't call me all "Ryosan".

770
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,130
Ryosan ... Ah!
What's Mina?

Yeah ... fuel!
Get it!

00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,140
There's a jet plane over there.

786
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:11,116
It's
like Air Force One with only four passengers .

787
00:47:11,117 --> 00:47:15,620
(Ohara) Yeah, but ...
(Terai) Something isn't calm.

788
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:19,624
Ryo-chan, what are you doing now?
(Terai) Speaking of that.

789
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:22,627
After all,
I left it in Hawaii .

790
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,463
Huh.

791
00:47:24,464 --> 00:47:27,632
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I'm getting a little poor.</font>

792
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:31,233
If I go back to Japan,
do I write a petition for reduction sentence?

793
00:47:36,642 --> 00:47:39,478
Wow! All right.

794
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:42,814
With this,
you can pull it to Japan .

795
00:47:42,815 --> 00:47:44,316
Yokkoi Shot.

796
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:47,486
Wow!

797
00:47:47,487 --> 00:47:50,155
It's
good.

798
00:47:50,156 --> 00:47:53,492
Wow, it's cold.

799
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:57,496
As expected, the altitude of 8,000 meters
will freeze.

800
00:47:57,497 --> 00:47:59,697
To the two who lost.

801
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:04,769
(Wind noise)

802
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,607
Haa' has been melted at last body.
Ryosan

803
00:48:08,608 --> 00:48:11,108
It's kind of awesome.
(Mina Ryotsu) Wow!

804
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:14,112
I can't shake.

805
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:16,448
I wonder if it got into turbulence.

806
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:19,784
Apparently there is a large typhoon
.

807
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:22,621
Is it a typhoon?
(Nakagawa) No worries.

808
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:24,722
It doesn't collide with the course.

809
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,961
Ryosan, the rope is about to break!

810
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:32,462
Can you really reach Japan?

811
00:48:43,563 --> 00:48:48,563
(Anunser) One morning after an amazing incident , this
morning the task force was opened at the Katsushika Station .

812
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:52,650
(Director Tonda) No, I wonder if
such a big incident will happen at my station .

813
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:54,066
No, no.

814
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:57,903
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Protect the citizens of whatever UFO is .</font>

815
00:48:57,904 --> 00:49:00,204
This is the police mission.

816
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:04,577
(Television: Announcer) The UFO that flew away
disappeared steadily from the radar.

817
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:07,246
It has not been discovered yet.

818
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:11,250
Now, where should I
blow it away?

819
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:15,087
Ahahahahahaha
.

820
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:18,257
If you only smashed that much , it should
have been a good enough distribution .

821
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:20,760
It's still not enough.

822
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:24,961
I'll
show you the fear of Hiryumaru even more.

823
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,200
turn down! To
continue such a horrible thing .

824
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:32,771
what.

825
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:37,443
Ugu.

826
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:41,280
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
You are the one who made the terrifying weapon .</font>

827
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:44,950
Different Hiryuumaru ... Uh.
Different?

828
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:48,788
Wow.
You're our accomplice. ➡

829
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:51,489
Never think again!

830
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:58,161
look! I can see Japan. I did it
!

831
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:03,302
(Mina Ryotsu) Wow!

832
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,807
Wow!

833
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:17,316
Sakonji
Let's take our comfort trip to Hawaii.

834
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:19,318
Eh?
(Volvo) If you go to Hawaii ➡

835
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,320
Can you meet Agnes Rum?

836
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:23,823
Maybe we can meet
that "Weekly Playboy"

837
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:26,824
That's because it was in
1975. (Volvo) Go !?

838
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:30,228
Wow!

839
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:37,702
Wow!

840
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:47,343
Itetete ...
What's that? Ah!

841
00:50:51,284 --> 00:50:53,284
It's Agnes Lamb. ➡

842
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:55,955
Uhhh.

843
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:57,957
Ah?
Yacht.

844
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:01,627
Sakonji Volvo Answering your hard work ...
Ah?

845
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:03,963
Ah ...
what are you doing Volvo?

846
00:51:03,964 --> 00:51:07,800
(Sakonji) Ryotsu It's a
huge Hawaii souvenir.

847
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:09,969
This is a souvenir!
≪ (Hiryumaru flight sound)

848
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,470
Ah.

849
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,941
Ahhhhh!

850
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:23,816
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
That is ... Hiryumaru!</font>

851
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:26,217
Let's go Ryosan.
King! All right.

852
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:36,495
Chief, I'm back now.

853
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:38,497
Oh Ohara.

854
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:41,834
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> This is the biggest
incident since the beginning of the Katsushika Police Department .</font>

855
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:46,005
It was a great effort
to create a countermeasure headquarters, but ➡

856
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:49,175
The UFO invasion is
not a job under the jurisdiction ➡

857
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:51,610
Had
it been moved to the main office .

858
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,445
Yeah.
(Terai) After all ➡

859
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:57,283
Is it an alien invasion?
(Nakagawa) No way.

860
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,952
How is the chief?
(Director Tonda) That is still ➡

861
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,954
I don't understand at all.
&lt;&lt; (Hiryumaru flight sound)

862
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:04,623
(All) What? Ah!

863
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:06,292
Wow!

864
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:21,793
♬～

865
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:28,314
Well, I
'm afraid to land at the police station .

866
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:32,818
After all, as Terai says, is this an
alien invasion?

867
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,653
I just have to ask.

868
00:52:34,654 --> 00:52:37,323
Someone got a loudspeaker.
(Police officer) Ha.

869
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:43,224
Whoa are you,
where did you come from?

870
00:52:44,906 --> 00:52:51,604
There is no reaction.
(Terai) After all it is the word of the earth ➡

871
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:53,272
Isn't it understandable?

872
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:56,442
Then what should I do?
(Captain Tonita) OK !

873
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:59,111
Omaetachihananimonoda.

874
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:02,281
Docokara Yattekita ~.

875
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:04,950
It's
not UFO!

876
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:06,452
Ryo-chan.
(Nakagawa) Senior?

877
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:08,954
That child is certain ...

878
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:10,456
Oops.
Daddy!

879
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:14,293
Mina Wait.
Release it, release both!

880
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:16,962
Ryotsu, how are you from Hawaii?

881
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:19,965
Uh than that,
it's not UFO.

882
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:23,802
It's a Hiryumaru made by Ryuhei.
Hiryuumaru?

883
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:27,473
Who is that Ryuhei
? My dad.

884
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:29,308
I was kidnapped in Hawaii.

885
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:32,311
(Speaker: Tiger) Japanese police officers.
(Terai) Talked.

886
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,647
(Speaker: Tiger)
However, it was a bad thing. ➡

887
00:53:34,648 --> 00:53:38,484
What is such a small police station as a
countermeasure headquarters?

888
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,819
If so, I will go to the main
office ...

889
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,321
Ah, lend me a little
.

890
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:45,324
Who the hell are you!

891
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:49,828
(Tiger) Hahahaha'
or'll let you call Tiger and even.

892
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:51,764
Is it a tiger? Ah.

893
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:54,600
What is Tiger I
'll not a parenthesis dotted!

894
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:57,603
Jack Robinson
you guys purpose of'm what a!

895
00:53:57,604 --> 00:53:59,605
That's right.

896
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:04,777
(Speaker: Tiger) We demand 10 billion
yen from the Japanese government .

897
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:07,112
Hya 10 billion yen !?

898
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:09,949
Get ready within 24 hours.

899
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,119
Otherwise, the capital Tokyo will be
destroyed.

900
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,620
Do it.

901
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:19,458
(Speaker: Tiger) Look carefully.➡

902
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:23,462
This devil's weapon,
the fear of Hiryumaru!

903
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:27,263
Happy!
Wait, Mina is dangerous.

904
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:32,304
Ah ... uh.

905
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:46,485

906
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:48,654

Kussoc Tiger!

910
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:22,621
(Anunser) The disk-shaped weapon
that destroyed Sensoji Temple yesterday

911
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:26,458
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> It turned out
to belong to a group of terrorists who call themselves Tiger .</font>

912
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:30,462
Tiger demands 10 billion yen
from the Japanese government .

913
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:35,134
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> A statement was
issued that if this is not followed, it will destroy Tokyo.➡</font>

914
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:38,435
The government immediately
entered into a consultation.

915
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:45,644
(Ohara) Then, are the people who
sank the ship in Hawaii the criminals?

916
00:55:45,645 --> 00:55:49,314
There is no doubt.
Dad will be in there.

917
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:53,252
Director
Is there any way to rescue Ryuhei ?

918
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:56,255
But that's the case with
the Japanese government ...

919
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:58,256
Whoops
.

920
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:02,928
The government
seems to have decided to refuse Tiger's request .

921
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,430
(All) Eh !?

922
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:07,933
But
Ryupei is caught in it.

923
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:12,771
The government's policy is
to never give in to terrorism .

924
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:16,442
Such!
(Airplane engine sound)

925
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:19,445
That is?
(Reiko) It's a SDF jet plane.

926
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:22,448
No way to
shoot down with a missile ...

927
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:25,117
It's a reconnaissance plane.

928
00:56:25,118 --> 00:56:27,119
N'Mina Come.
Ee'?

929
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,220
Oi Ryotsu
Where are you going?

930
00:56:35,628 --> 00:56:38,630
(Subordinate 3) Boss
Jet aircraft is approaching.

931
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:40,966
It looks like a SDF reconnaissance plane.

932
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:45,471
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I don't
seem to understand the fear of this Hiryumaru yet .</font>

Drop it with a tornado.

934

936
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:04,590
Wahahahahaha
, this is what happens when you spoil me.

937
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:07,591
If this
happens, I'll break it more flashy .

938
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:13,098
Good, good, good.

939
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,766
That.
(Naoko and Komachi) Oh!

940
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:16,935
Ryotsu Kankichi!

941
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:19,605
What are
you doing with our mini pass !

942
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:23,106
The fuel for Zero Fighter is empty.
(Komachi / Naoko) What?

943
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,445
I can still fly.

944
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:30,949
Yoshi Volvo Sakonji!
(Sakonji, Volvo) Good morning!

945
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,784
(Naoko)
Fly an onboro airplane like this ➡

946
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:37,122
What should I do? The
other party is UFO.

947
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:40,626
(Komachi) You
shouldn't be fooled by such a primitive person .

948
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:43,462
I want to help my dad.
You guys

949
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:46,632
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
You didn't know Mina's maneuvering technique .</font>

950
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,633
Mina, let's go
.

951
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:52,704
(Komachi) It's a bit dangerous!

952
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:03,248
What? Hiryumaru is now in Ueno?
(Terai / Reiko) Yeah?

953
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:05,249
(scream)

954
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:25,103
(Tiger) Wahahahaha
Do more flashy.

955
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:28,106
I hate Tokyo.

956
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:31,944
Asakusa Ueno
Everyone, blow it away.

957
00:58:31,945 --> 00:58:36,281
Why do you hate Tokyo so much
because you were born in America?

958
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:39,451
shut up!
I don't like it.

959
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:41,620
(Subordinate 3)
Boss Something is approaching.

960
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:44,456
What's another jet plane?
(Subordinate 3) No.

961
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:47,257
It
seems smaller and slower.

962
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:56,068
(Tiger) What?
If not, it's not a zero game.

963
00:58:56,069 --> 00:59:00,569
Are you stupid?
Ei , I 'll kick you with a tornado.

964
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,410
Wow!

965
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:12,918
♬～

966
00:59:12,919 --> 00:59:15,420
Shit quick guy.

967
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:18,423
It's above Mina
. Fly higher than Hiryumaru.

968
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:19,925
I know.

969
00:59:19,926 --> 00:59:26,932
♬～

970
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:28,433
How about that?

971
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:31,936
Wow!

972
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:37,609
Ugh.

973
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:45,784
♬～

974
00:59:45,785 --> 00:59:48,287
No,
I can't get close at all.

975
00:59:48,288 --> 00:59:51,456
It ’s a
fuel!

976
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:53,959
After all it is a foot pad at all in the mini pat
.

977
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,660
It's okay if this
happens. Once you dive under the tornado.

978
01:00:03,803 --> 01:00:07,413
Where is? (Subordinate 1) It seems
that you have entered the blind spot.

979
01:00:12,312 --> 01:00:13,812
Looked!

980
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:17,865
(Subordinate 1) Above!
(Tiger) What !?

981
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:21,987
Mina Leave it to me.

982
01:00:21,988 --> 01:00:23,488
Both!

983
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:27,826
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Hmm ... Yoshcha, hello!</font>

984
01:00:27,827 --> 01:00:30,329
Ugh! Ugh ...

985
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,830
Both!

986
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,832
That is….

987
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,334
Mina.

988
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:37,836
Mina? Who is that?

989
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:40,505
My daughter.
Daughter?

990
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:44,009
There is someone on the plane.
(Tiger) What?

991
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,210
Eee, shake it off.

992
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:50,782
No!
Kya!

993
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:53,983
Mina!
(Electronic sound)

994
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:59,624
Uhhh ...

995
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:03,128
Mina!
I'll go fast, I'll run out of fuel.

996
01:01:03,129 --> 01:01:04,629
I understand.

997
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,468
Mina ...

998
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,972
(Tiger) Who
told me to stop the tornado on my own !

999
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,474
≪ Ryuhei!
Yup?

1000
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:19,478
I'm Ryotsu
Kankichi, stop Hiryumaru!

1001
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:21,980
Kankichi.
What? This guy.

1002
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:25,281
(Gunshot)
Uhhh! Wow.

1003
01:01:27,153 --> 01:01:29,953
Ah ... Uhhh!

1004
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:36,161
(Gunshot)
Wow!

1005
01:01:36,162 --> 01:01:37,662
Kankichi!

1006
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,165
Ah.
(Subordinate 1) Uhhh.

1007
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,666
Wow wow ...

1008
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:44,802
No!

1009
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:48,172
Wow, hit!

1010
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,611
Wow!

1011
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:56,615
It
seems that Hiryumaru crashed on Nakagawa Bridge.

1012
01:01:56,616 --> 01:01:58,450
What?
(Reiko) I'm sure both are ➡

1013
01:01:58,451 --> 01:02:01,787
I did it.
(Nakagawa) Early arrest of Tiger.

1014
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:04,956
However, if the jurisdiction does not move
, from the top ...

1015
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:11,087
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> Isn't
it my responsibility to fall into the chief Nakagawa ?</font>

1016
01:02:11,964 --> 01:02:13,464
Ryuhei!

1017
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:17,501
Uhhh ...

1018
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:20,138
Ha!

1019
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,478
Ryuhei!

1020
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:27,979
Kankichi!

1021
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,180
Is it safe? Ryuhei!
Ah.

1022
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:34,486
Hah huh.

1023
01:02:34,487 --> 01:02:37,155
Why is Mina in
Japan?

1024
01:02:37,156 --> 01:02:40,492
I'm not sure
I came to help you.

1025
01:02:40,493 --> 01:02:43,995
Eh?
(Steam whistle)

1026
01:02:43,996 --> 01:02:46,696
Ryotsu!
(Sakonji) I came to help!

1027
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:50,602
Oh yeah ...

1028
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:53,772
Uhh ... oh.

1029
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:55,273
Ah! ➡

1030
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,610
in the way.

1031
01:03:00,947 --> 01:03:03,615
(Volvo) Where is Tiger?
I'm still inside.

1032
01:03:03,616 --> 01:03:06,116
All right!
(Sakonji) Yeah!

1033
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,619
(Volvo Sakonji) Eh? Ah, it's
dangerous!

1034
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,458
(Volvo) Wow!

1035
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:24,135
Ugh shit!

1036
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:26,736
(Police car siren)

1037
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,309
Kankichi.

1038
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:34,813
I
've been helping you since I was a kid .

1039
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:36,314
There is no such thing.

1040
01:03:36,315 --> 01:03:39,317
I am the one
who often does your homework ...

1041
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:42,318
Or fall within that helped such a thing.
I N ...

1042
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:46,992
Do you remember Spring break for 3 years.

1043
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:50,929
When I was being bullied by
a general kid in that school ...

1044
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,931
"Wow!"

1045
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:56,768
(General Gaki) 《Hehehehehe
I'll get this.》

1046
01:03:56,769 --> 01:04:00,105
《Stop it, return it
if you return it! 》

1047
01:04:00,106 --> 01:04:02,107
"Huh." &lt;&lt;
Ah! 》

1048
01:04:02,108 --> 01:04:03,775
(laughter)

1049
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:05,944
《Huh, what a weakling.➡

1050
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:08,280
If you want me to return it,
take it. ”

1051
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:09,781
"Uh ..." &lt;&lt;
Wait! 》

1052
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:11,783
(Children) &lt;&lt; Ah? 》

1053
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:15,620
"you!
What are you doing to my friend?

1054
01:04:15,621 --> 01:04:17,122
《Kankichi ...》

1055
01:04:17,123 --> 01:04:21,126
《Hun ’s funny,
are you gonna do this with me? ➡

1056
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:23,795
Hi! 》

1057
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:27,299
"Eh! 》
《Ah! 》

1058
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,635
(Groaning voice)

1059
01:04:30,636 --> 01:04:32,136
"See."

1060
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,640
"Hi! 》

1061
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:38,941
Hahahaha, I forgot
that.

1062
01:04:40,313 --> 01:04:42,213
I remember it well.

1063
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:45,716
&lt;&lt; Tiki Show, remember it! 》

1064
01:04:47,486 --> 01:04:50,155
It's like a pinch of the earth,
coming from space

1065
01:04:50,156 --> 01:04:51,756
It was like a hero.

1066
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:53,657
"Ah…."

1067
01:04:55,094 --> 01:04:58,096
I also wanted to be like Kankichi.

1068
01:04:58,097 --> 01:05:00,765
But ... I couldn't.

1069
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,266
On the contrary, I ...

1070
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:05,103
Ryuhei ...

1071
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,740
Ryuhei. I
know.

1072
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,950
Hmm?

1073
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:27,792
You see.
Oh.

1074
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,498
Oh ... papa!

1075
01:05:38,137 --> 01:05:40,437
I'm sorry!
eh?

1076
01:05:43,643 --> 01:05:47,812
I
'm really sorry I couldn't do anything until now.

1077
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:49,481
Daddy.
I'm sorry.

1078
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:51,249
eh?

1079
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,750
I
'm sorry for everything .

1080
01:05:56,589 --> 01:05:58,089
I ’m sorry, I ’m sorry.

1081
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:01,593
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> What
do you say to your first daughter when it was born ?</font>

1082
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:03,094
Mina ...

1083
01:06:03,095 --> 01:06:06,431
I
didn't want to hear those words .

1084
01:06:06,432 --> 01:06:08,632
Ah Mina.
(Naoko) Wait a minute!

1085
01:06:14,106 --> 01:06:15,606
Ryuhei.

1086
01:06:25,951 --> 01:06:29,151
Don't worry
they're on.

1087
01:06:37,797 --> 01:06:42,497
Ryuhei: What happened? Could you
tell me?

1088
01:06:44,303 --> 01:06:48,306
I've been fooled for a long time.

1089
01:06:48,307 --> 01:06:50,742
In a letter to Kathy who didn't receive a reply

1090
01:06:50,743 --> 01:06:54,746
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> I
thought I was a research fool and was abandoned.</font>

1091
01:06:54,747 --> 01:06:57,415
Of course I
didn't even know about Mina.

1092
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:01,920
But that was
a work for Tiger not to leave me .

1093
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:06,591
So
you had to study that horrible weapon ?

1094
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:09,427
Hiryumaru is not a weapon.

1095
01:07:09,428 --> 01:07:14,099
What I was studying was a
machine that eliminated typhoons.

1096
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,200
Extinguish the typhoon?

1097
01:07:16,378 --> 01:07:25,276
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Is it really possible to put out a typhoon ?</font>

1098
01:07:25,277 --> 01:07:30,281
Yes, Hiryumaru stores the plasma-decomposed
atmosphere in super compressed form.

1099
01:07:30,282 --> 01:07:34,786
By explosively reducing and releasing
it in the center of the typhoon

1100
01:07:34,787 --> 01:07:37,455
You
can eliminate the typhoon .

1101
01:07:37,456 --> 01:07:41,292
Hmm, I do
n't understand at all even if it is explained .

1102
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:44,796
Isn't Tiger
attacking again with Hiryumaru?

1103
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:46,965
No worries.

1104
01:07:46,966 --> 01:07:51,569
The tiger can steer,
but it can't raise a tornado .

1105
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:54,570
(Insect call)

1106
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,078
Hey Naoko.

1107
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,914
Are you hungry?
Let's go eat something.

1108
01:08:02,915 --> 01:08:05,583
No ... but Mina.

1109
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:07,585
Mina
eat delicious food

1110
01:08:07,586 --> 01:08:09,921
You'll be fine
(Naoko) Right.

1111
01:08:09,922 --> 01:08:11,422
What do you want to do?

1112
01:08:17,596 --> 01:08:19,597
Uh ...

1113
01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:21,766
Alright, I'm sure.
(Naoko) Yeah.

1114
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:24,602
Mina! that? ➡

1115
01:08:24,603 --> 01:08:26,104
Mina?

1116
01:08:26,105 --> 01:08:28,605
Mina?
(Naoko) Mina!

1117
01:08:29,608 --> 01:08:31,109
(Komachi / Naoko) Yeah?

1118

01:08:34,446 --> 01:08:37,448
Yes Katsushika station.
☎ (Tiger) Me.

1120
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:40,449
That voice is Tiger.
(Everyone) Eh !?

1121
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:43,955
☎ Mina is in custody. ➡

1122
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:46,958
If you
want me to return it safely, bring Ryuuhei.

1123
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:48,793
What!?
Crap!

1124

☎ Tomorrow morning 6:00
from Shinagawa Pier by boat ➡

☎ (sound the call is disconnected)
Ugh ...

1128
01:09:00,072 --> 01:09:02,907
Damn dirty shit!
(Sound of hitting the desk)

1129
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:05,410
Please
, let me go.

1130
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,745
Yongpyong ...
Useless.

1131
01:09:07,746 --> 01:09:11,249
If you get into the hands of a tiger
, the town will be back with a tornado.

1132
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,650
No, I
'll never do that again.

1133
01:09:19,351 --> 01:09:28,000
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Hm Tokyo town , I'll be crushing it soon.</font>

1134
01:09:28,005 --> 01:09:31,173
What are you talking about like a cartoon villain
?

1135
01:09:31,174 --> 01:09:33,509
Uh ...
about your purpose

1136
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:36,679
It's money, isn't it?

1137
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,682
(Subordinate 4)
What do you say to the boss !

1138
01:09:39,683 --> 01:09:42,018
Since please
are you doing saying please.

1139
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:43,853
Ah, it's ugly.

1140
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:47,023
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
What should I do to destroy Tokyo in general ?</font>

1141
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:51,027
Hmm revenge.
Revenge?

1142
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:55,364
I used to
live in this town for a year when I was a kid .

1143
01:09:55,365 --> 01:09:59,535
At that time there was only one
humiliating event in my life .

1144
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:02,038
Humiliation?

1145
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,709
I swore to my heart,
someday I'll take revenge on this town.

1146
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:09,545
I think I'll crush this town. Uhu
.

1147
01:10:09,546 --> 01:10:11,547
It's like a bacca.
What ?!

1148
01:10:11,548 --> 01:10:15,051
I
wondered what it was because I said revenge

1149
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:18,220
In short
, it's not a child's revenge.

1150
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:20,222
Shut up!
Ugh.

1151
01:10:20,223 --> 01:10:23,893
(Tiger) Don't forget you're a
hostage.

1152
01:10:23,894 --> 01:10:27,730
I'm afraid I
don't mean anything to the hostage.

1153
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:30,066
What?

1154
01:10:30,067 --> 01:10:32,902
They say it's not worth it.

1155
01:10:32,903 --> 01:10:34,403
(Tiger) Nothing. ➡

1156
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:37,239
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Ryuhei will always come to help you .</font>

1157
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,842
Not really!
Hugh.

1158
01:10:39,843 --> 01:10:43,012
He was always
concerned about his family.➡

1159
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:45,348
If you know that your daughter was born ➡

1160
01:10:45,349 --> 01:10:48,017
I
'm sure I 'm back in Hawaii .

1161
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:50,353
eh?
(Tiger) Letter from Hawaii ➡

1162
01:10:50,354 --> 01:10:52,021
All were disposed.➡

1163
01:10:52,022 --> 01:10:56,025
But also came a letter that my daughter was born
Yongpyong Conversely

1164
01:10:56,026 --> 01:10:58,527
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I replied that I was dead in an accident .</font>

1165
01:10:58,528 --> 01:11:00,196
Hahahahaha.

1166
01:11:00,197 --> 01:11:04,367
Nahahahaha ...

1167
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:06,869
Terrible! You're the worst.

1168
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,538
Hmm, no matter what.

1169
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:12,639
Anyway,
he will definitely come .

1170
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:23,386
(Ohara) I
thought it was a substitute operation .

1171
01:11:23,387 --> 01:11:27,390
Even if I make a mistake, I ca
n't give Ryuhei to Tiger .

1172
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:31,227
But aren't even fake guys coming out?
(Ohara) All right.

1173
01:11:31,228 --> 01:11:33,396
Honda's profile is very similar.

1174
01:11:33,397 --> 01:11:36,407
It is okay if it does not come
out until the hostage exchange .

1175
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:40,336
(Director Tonda)
First of all, rescue Mina.

1176
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:43,339
Even so,
it looks exactly like Mr. Honda .

1177
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,842
(Director Tonda) Umm It
is Ryuhei itself from a distance.

1178
01:11:46,843 --> 01:11:50,513
(Honda) How is it right?
(All) Eh?

1179
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,682
What are you doing?
(Honda) What?

1180
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:57,686
Then this Ryuhei is ...
(Nakagawa) It's a real Ryuhei.

1181
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:00,689
(Ohara) Oh!
(Honda) Yeah, before what?

1182
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:04,693
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> Ryo-
chan, that was the intention from the beginning.</font>

1183
01:12:04,694 --> 01:12:07,530
(Radio: Ohara) Ryotsu Ryotsu
Reply, Ryotsu.

1184
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:09,365
Excuse me, manager.

1185
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,700
I really
want to go to Ryuhei .

1186
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:15,101
(Wireless: Ohara) But ...
Anyway, leave it to me.

1187
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,879
Don't worry, Ryupira
Mina rescues her safely.

1188
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,049
I
won't give you anything to Tiger.

1189
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,050
Kankichi ... Ah!

1190
01:12:46,002 --> 01:12:48,170
Tiger!
Where is Mina?

1191
01:12:48,171 --> 01:12:52,508
Unfortunately it's not here.
What !?

1192
01:12:52,509 --> 01:12:55,678
(Tiger) Look behind you! ➡

1193
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,079
My daughter is over there.

1194
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,851
Mina!
Shit.

1195
01:13:01,852 --> 01:13:04,353
Mina is in
Yurikamome.

1196
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:07,690
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font> Contact
the new transportation system immediately .</font>

1197
01:13:07,691 --> 01:13:10,860
(Tiger) Ryuhei,
please come to me quietly.

1198
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:14,196
Shikmina was there
...

1199
01:13:14,197 --> 01:13:17,397
Early white
or May it happened to my daughter.

1200
01:13:18,368 --> 01:13:19,869
Ryuhei!

1201
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,371
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
That's the only way to help Mina .</font>

1202
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:25,172
I'm my father.
Ryuhei ...

1203
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:28,109
Fluffy.

1204
01:13:28,211 --> 01:13:32,548
The Yurikamome system has been
destroyed.

1205
01:13:32,549 --> 01:13:34,717
What !?
(Reiko) Tiger's work.

1206
01:13:34,718 --> 01:13:36,552
Shit.

1207
01:13:36,553 --> 01:13:38,721
Volvo Sakonji Can you hear me?

1208
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:40,922
Head to Yurikamome.

1209
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:48,029
Ryuhei will enter Hiryumaru.

1210
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:54,336
This is all right
. Release Mina as soon as possible.

1211
01:13:54,337 --> 01:13:56,172
No
! What ?!

1212
01:13:56,173 --> 01:14:00,676
First, make a tornado
or my daughter won't release.

1213
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:02,377
Damn ...

1214
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:07,849
Ryuhei ...

1215
01:14:17,194 --> 01:14:19,194
Wow what ?!

1216
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,031
What did you do.

1217
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:26,632
If you continue to inhale air as it is, the
internal pressure is limited to 30 minutes.

1218
01:14:27,871 --> 01:14:30,873
Hiryumaru self-destructs.
What !?

1219
01:14:30,874 --> 01:14:33,209
Let's release Mina!

1220
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,711
(Ohara)
Oh, Hiryumaru has started to move.

1221
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:38,047
Oh!
(Nakagawa) No way, Ryuhei has a tornado.

1222
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:39,648
Eh?
(Reiko) That's right!

1223
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:42,318
Ikan Volvo Sakonji Temple.
(Volvo) Understood!

1224
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:45,519
It's rushing!
(siren)

1225
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:48,157
You're stupid!

1226
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:50,159
(Volvo) Wow!

1227
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,328
(Subordinate 5) Police!
(Subordinate 4) Get out!

1228
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:53,829
(Subordinate 6) Yes.

1229
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:57,599
Damn it.

1230
01:14:59,336 --> 01:15:02,171
(Gunshot)
No!

1231
01:15:02,172 --> 01:15:05,841
Hiryumaru is
n't exactly what you want.

1232
01:15:05,842 --> 01:15:08,842
Let's release Mina!
Ugh.

1233
01:15:09,846 --> 01:15:12,348
You!
Ugh.

1234
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:15,049
Uh Ryuhei! Hey!
Wow!

1235
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:20,522
Kankichi!
Ryuhei Yurikamome started running.

1236
01:15:20,523 --> 01:15:23,359
I'll do the rest.
No!

1237
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,529
Hiryumaru will self-destruct in 30 minutes.
What !?

1238
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:29,698
It's
set up like that.

1239
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:32,368
I'll do something about
you here Mina!

1240
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:34,036
But ...

1241
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:37,373
You're your father, go fast!

1242
01:15:37,374 --> 01:15:39,074
I understand.

1243
01:15:42,646 --> 01:15:46,148
Oh wait!
Aitetsu.

1244
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:59,495

1245

Wow ...

1246
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,866
Stop it and stop.

1247
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:09,603
Wow! Hey!

01:26:41,971 --> 01:26:44,071
The goal is ...

1411
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:48,643
Director! I use Hiryumaru
to eliminate the typhoon.

What ? (Ohara) What?</font>

Originally, Hiryumaru was
a machine for that purpose.

1414
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:59,154
If you follow the original function, Hiryumaru
should be able to avoid self-destruction.

1415
01:26:59,155 --> 01:27:02,490
It's dangerous
. I don't know if I will succeed.

Both are dead!

Do n't worry, Hiryumaru
is not a weapon of destruction.

1422
01:27:18,674 --> 01:27:22,177
Instead of Ryuhei, I
'll prove it.

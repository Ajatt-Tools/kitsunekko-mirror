1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,280
- Head Teacher.
- Yes?

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,700
So I've heard that these two were
involved in compensated dating.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,310
Compensated dating?

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,480
Ma'am!

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,230
I don't know a thing about this!

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,700
What's the meaning of this,
Nakamaru-sensei?

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,060
Yes, well, there's...

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,900
We didn't sell ourselves!

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Why don't we do some
compensated dating?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,100
What's wrong with
compensated dating?

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,910
You serious?

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,600
If you do it for money, then it
means you enjoy money

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,100
more than sex, right?

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,920
That would be terrible.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,790
When you do it with
the person you really love,

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,890
it's the greatest
feeling you can have.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,500
<i>For a teacher to engage
in adulterous acts</i>

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>with his student, what do you
think you're doing!</i>

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,400
<i>It's true...</i>

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,900
We took money.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,300
So it was fraudulent dating?

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,190
On top of that, it seems your
partner was Onizuka-sensei.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,170
- But he didn't do anything!
- In addition!

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,860
Nakamaru-sensei, you knew
about this, didn't you?

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,450
Is this true, Nakamaru-sensei?

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,850
Yes well, there's was...

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,050
- Head Teacher!
- Yes?

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,310
Did you think the school could
cover up such an incident?

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,100
No, not at all!

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,600
We will open an urgent
investigation and get to the truth.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,140
There's no need for that!

32
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,840
I cannot leave this to you.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,800
Tomorrow, I will call together
a PTA officers meeting.

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,070
This way, please.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,530
Please have a seat.

36
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,900
Thank you for coming.

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,720
So, it looks like Miyabi's mom
is finally involved.

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,810
Miyabi must have snitched
about Chikako and Erika.

39
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,500
Those two are with Onizuka now
and she must have

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,300
- been really pissed.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,700
I wonder if Miyabi won't
give up this boycott.

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,300
I don't think she'll give up
until Onizuka's fired.

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,420
Yeah well, it doesn't really
matter to me.

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,820
Me too, I'm getting tired of this.

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,480
It's Miyabi!

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,220
It's almost fall session.

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
There better not be anyone
here who's thinking

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
of going to Onizuka's class,
is there?

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,560
I hope you all haven't forgotten

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,620
about Takeshi's death.

51
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,120
We made a vow to never
trust adults.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,660
If you betray me,
I'll never forgive you!

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,300
That there were students
of this Seirin Academy involved

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,960
with compensated dating,

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,180
as PTA president, I find
it shocking and disappointing.

56
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,100
In addition, these students,
until recently,

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,540
were excellent students
and good friends of my daughter.

58
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,400
I asked my daughter why they
would become involved

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,370
in something so improper.

60
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,080
It was a because,

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,800
it was all because of their
homeroom teacher Onizuka-sensei,

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
don't you think?

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,300
As further evidence of this,

64
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,780
class 2-4 is currently
boycotting his class.

65
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,200
As a teacher,
Onizuka-sensei's conduct

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,570
is irresponsible and reckless.

67
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,760
He is leading our dear children
astray down a path of evil!

68
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,170
No matter what, it is the parent's
duty to rescue their children.

69
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,470
I feel that these situations
at schools,

70
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,900
these are the problems
I would like to debate

71
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,800
on my television program.

72
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,000
Without question, the schools
must be addressed about this.

73
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,790
And so...

74
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,770
To the president and all of you,

75
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,190
we regret this inconvenience.

76
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,390
I, Uchiyamada,
sincerely apologize.

77
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,400
But, please rest assured.

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Of course, the students,
and the teacher involved

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,710
in this incident,
will be quickly dealt with.

80
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,190
And further, as the president
was concerned,

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,700
if by the fall session the students
of his class do not end

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,250
their boycott, he will
automatically be released.

83
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,630
It's because you're so lax like this
that this happens!

84
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,600
Right now, Uchiyamada-sensei,
as head teacher,

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
your authority is being
undermined.

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
Don't you think it's strange
that the director has left

87
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,600
the post of principal open
for half a year?

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,950
We're working hard on that...

89
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,800
It's because you use
stereotypical answers like that

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
that no one takes you seriously.

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,100
That's why the director hasn't
made you principal.

92
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,050
- But that's...
- That's enough.

93
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,140
I will ask myself.

94
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,800
Onizuka-sensei,

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,400
is there anything you wish
to say in your defense?

96
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,590
Onizuka-sensei!

97
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,510
Alright! He won! Perfect!

98
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,900
I placed a bet.

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,000
You know, summer's almost over
and I was running out of money.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,670
Hey, my treat today,
on anything!

101
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,900
You!

102
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,200
Just when I thought you were
sincerely listening with concern,

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,500
betting on the horse races!

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,910
But man, you're talking
for so long, lady.

105
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,310
- Lady?!
- What are you thinking?

106
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,000
It was because of you.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,100
You're responsible
for Ôshima Chikako

108
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,000
and Tsukishima Erika's
delinquency!

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,890
That's been resolved already!
They've both apologized.

110
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,590
Do you think that solves this?

111
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,500
Geeze, they've properly
apologized!

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,390
You cannot fool me!

113
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,900
Didn't you go with that student
to a love hotel?

114
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,590
It's pretty interesting you know.

115
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,900
It even had karaoke.

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,490
Hey, you should take your
husband and check it out!

117
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,800
That student requested money,
and you gave it to her, didn't you?

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,190
Yeah, you know that Chikako,
she ain't cheap!

119
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,090
My God! As an adult do you
realize your situation?

120
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,590
Not to worry!

121
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,890
You see... I restrained myself.

122
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,410
I've had enough!

123
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,400
To have a discussion with
a person like you

124
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,750
is a total waste of time!

125
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,900
To see the the problem
of this teacher,

126
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,550
the situation of this school,
I am in utter amazement!

127
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,400
I have determined that this
situation must be

128
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,700
solved at all costs!

129
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,660
What do you all think?

130
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,900
Would you consider letting
myself deal with this incident.

131
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
We agree!

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
Well then...

133
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,680
Since the PTA's officers
are in agreement,

134
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,900
the two students will be expelled.

135
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,700
We also demand that
the school dismiss

136
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Onizuka-sensei immediately!

137
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
With that, this meeting
is adjourned.

138
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,030
Please hold on a minute.

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,420
Everyone, please listen.

140
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,900
There's more to this.

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,820
This is not something you
should be butting into.

142
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
But!

143
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,220
Or... is there something you
can do about it?

144
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,420
Something that could
overturn our decision?

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
You're really into it today,
aren't you?

We will be informing your family.

168
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,220
Understand?

169
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,900
Director, it's because of your
constant indecisiveness,

170
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,400
waiting until fall session...

171
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,700
If you had fired Onizuka
immediately when class 2-4

172
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,500
started their boycott,
this wouldn't have happened!

173
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I cannot restrain myself
any longer,

174
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
it's all because of Onizuka.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,100
Without any power of authority,

176
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,390
the PTA president made
a fool of me!

177
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,330
Because of Onizuka, we were
made to look responsible.

178
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,980
Not only that...

179
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,860
- On top of that, my daughter...
- What's that?

180
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,460
Did something happen
to your daughter?

181
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,880
Anyway!

182
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,200
I am no longer like the usual
Uchiyamada!

183
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,800
Director, since you have not
done anything,

184
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
I will have you leave this
up to myself.

185
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,970
Will that be alright?

186
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,640
What is it?

187
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
Are Ôshima Chikako
and Tsukishima Erika going

188
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
to be expelled?

189
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,710
Those two have committed
a serious crime.

190
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,500
Rather than quickly removing
those who caused errors,

191
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,800
isn't it more important
to give them guidance

192
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
to the correct path?

193
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,300
Isn't that what we're supposed...

194
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,870
Those who commit crimes,

195
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,700
are punished, that's the rules
of the world.

196
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,400
It frightens me even more
to send children out into

197
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,880
the world not knowing this.

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,280
- But sir!
- Fuyutsuki-sensei,

199
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,870
you've been badly influenced
by Onizuka.

200
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,830
I think it's best if you
opened your eyes a bit.

201
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,300
Yes? What do you want?

202
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,100
Until the formal judgment
is given,

203
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
I told you to stay in your homes.

204
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,030
Are you saying they're trash?

205
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,590
This isn't any different
than that last time!

206
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,100
You know, this kind trash,
even after apologizing

207
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
will just go back to their
delinquency!

208
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,300
I said it then too.

209
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,000
These kids, they'll just go back
to their delinquency.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Why do you always make
judgments like that?!

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,400
What do you mean by that?

212
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,300
Do you understand your
own situation?

213
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
My situation's got nothing
to do with it!

214
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Why do you listen to that hag
from the PTA and you don't listen

215
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,670
- to a word we say?
- You see...

216
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,700
I don't have time for such silly
teachers like you!

217
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,280
Hold on there.

218
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,020
Hold on a sec!

219
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,500
Are you going to resort
to violence again?

220
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,980
Interesting...

221
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,780
They'll be no way out
of it if you do that.

222
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,450
What's wrong?

223
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,900
Why don't you go ahead
and do whatever you

224
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,100
want like last time.

225
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,310
Hurry and disappear from this
academy with this trash!

226
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,110
What's that?

227
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,670
- Stop it!
- Never mind already!

228
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,070
We'll quit this lame school!

229
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,700
It's okay, already.

230
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,110
We'll quit this lame school.

231
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,710
Please wait!

232
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,580
Onizuka-sensei and myself will
talk to the head teacher.

233
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,800
It's no use.

234
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,900
There's no way Uchiyamada
will listen.

235
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,780
It'll put you in a bad position too.

236
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,820
You work for this school,
after all.

237
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,080
That doesn't matter!

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,590
When you think about it,
being expelled is no big deal.

239
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,780
Besides, there's no future
with this school, yeah?

240
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,870
- See ya, Sensei.
- See ya.

241
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,370
It's okay!

242
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,360
I've got cash, so I'll take you
where ever you want to go!

243
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,260
Excuse me, can I come in?

244
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,230
Please...

245
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,800
Could it be, were you making
plans to go gallivanting

246
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,300
with that girl from last time?

247
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
No, I wasn't!

248
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,140
Hey, Fuyutsuki-sensei,
why don't you join us?

249
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,960
Have you forgotten those
two already?!

250
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,510
No way.

251
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,900
Then you shouldn't be making
plans to go out, should you?

252
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,800
Shouldn't you think of some way
to get those girls

253
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,600
- back into school?
- Like?

254
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,620
Like... Well...

255
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,500
Like talking to Aizawa Miyabi.

256
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,350
It was because she told her
mother that all of this happened.

257
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,340
- I see!
- Did you wash your hands?

258
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,300
We know that she became
distrustful of teachers because

259
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,170
of a past incident with the death
of a classmate.

260
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,470
Shouldn't you look into that?

261
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,880
Sorry...

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I've got no interest in the past.

263
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,600
So, are you saying that Ôshima
Chikako and Tsukishima Erika

264
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
are the past to you?

265
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
Or are you saying that because
you're going to be fired

266
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
- it doesn't matter...
- No, I...

267
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,780
Never mind! I'm not going
to ask you already!

268
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,890
Go ahead and get fired!
I don't care!

269
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
Unbelievable!

270
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,500
<i>How should we handle
these situations?</i>

271
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,900
<i>Aizawa-sensei, please?</i>

272
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,800
<i>Well, when children go astray,</i>

273
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,400
<i>to simply scold them
does no good.</i>

274
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,100
<i>You must first examine yourself
and see if there's any cause.</i>

275
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,450
<i>In most cases, the problem
comes from the parent.</i>

276
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,300
<i>How insightful, Aizawa-sensei.</i>

277
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,300
What a load of bull!
She doesn't know a thing!

278
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,530
What do you want?

279
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,240
Do you have a minute?

280
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,100
- Geeze, pops...
- Sensei...

281
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,590
You guys are late!

282
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,390
Sensei, this place...

283
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,590
Oh, don't let it bother you!

284
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
Alright, where to?

285
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,670
What's up?

286
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,740
- Is this okay, Sensei?
- What?

287
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,300
Should you be hanging
out with us?

288
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,200
You're going to be be
fired too, right?

289
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,570
Ah, don't worry about
stuff like that!

290
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,580
Summer vacation's almost over,
you have to enjoy it, right?

291
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,150
Okay! Let's go!

292
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,300
Hey you know, I just saw
someone going

293
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,680
on a compensated date.
Is that still popular?

294
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,880
Geeze, what a shame.

295
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,260
Sorry, but I've got a lot
of studying to do.

296
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,840
I wasn't you to tell the truth.

297
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,370
What are you talking about?

298
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,830
I'm asking,

299
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,640
didn't you do the same thing
as Ôshima-san?

300
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,900
You told your mother what you
did because you wanted

301
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
to hide that, right?

302
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,730
I really don't know what
you're talking about.

303
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,950
Don't you care that those two
are going to be expelled?

304
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,150
They were your good friends,
weren't they?

305
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,150
If you leave it like this,
it'll make you feel guilty.

306
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,310
Please,

307
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,470
please tell your mother
and the head teacher the truth.

308
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,810
You're just on Onizuka-
sensei's side.

309
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,710
Or could it be, you're in love
with Onizuka-sensei?

310
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,400
Don't be ridiculous!

311
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,900
That doesn't matter right now!

312
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,310
All I care about is that
Onizuka's gone!

313
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,260
Why?

314
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,220
Why have you become like this?

315
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,920
Just what happened?

316
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,820
How did Kunio Murai-kun's
best friend die?

317
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,300
- Please leave!
- Aizawa-san!

318
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,830
I've got nothing to say to you.

319
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,600
Have become a zealous teacher?

320
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,200
Don't make me laugh!
What can you do!

321
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,430
Oh man! None are falling!

322
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,630
Alright, let me handle this!

323
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,300
How's that!

324
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,740
Alright!

325
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,140
- How's that!
- Wow!

326
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,340
Nothing like in class!

327
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,700
- Isn't this teacher weird!
- Shaddap!

328
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,710
- What next?
- Lesse...

329
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,030
Oh no!

330
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,920
- Whatcha two doing?
- They're from our school.

331
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,860
Oh, it doesn't matter.

332
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,360
Well, it's still embarrassing,
yeah?

333
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,580
Murai-kun...

334
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,770
Wait!

335
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Murai-kun, why does Aizawa-san
hate Onizuka-sensei so much?

336
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,760
Why is it that she doesn't
trust adults?

337
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,740
Miyabi...

338
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
She was going steady with him.

339
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,060
With Takeshi.

340
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,200
When he was in intermediate,
he was the ace

341
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,590
of the baseball team.

342
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,300
They said he was sure
to become pro.

343
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,490
But then he hurt his shoulder.

344
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,280
They told him he would never
be able to throw like before.

345
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,020
That's when that previous
principal,

346
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,090
told him he should transfer
to a different school.

347
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,700
He said because he was fast
on his feet,

348
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,270
he should go to a school with
a good track and field team.

349
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,170
To go with his skills.

350
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,820
But actually he just wanted
to get rid of Takeshi.

351
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,800
You see, he was admitted
to school by recommendation

352
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,600
and concentrated on baseball,
he wasn't very smart.

353
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,870
So then,

354
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,100
if Takeshi couldn't play baseball,
there was no point

355
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,300
in keeping him here.

356
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,620
That's terrible.

357
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,860
That's why Takeshi said there
was no way he was transferring.

358
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,980
He didn't want to leave
Miyabi, either.

359
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,780
So then that principal went
to his parents!

360
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,200
Telling them that if they had
Takeshi transferred,

361
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
he'd assist them.

362
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,630
His father's factory was having
a hard time then.

363
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,900
What about his homeroom
teacher?

364
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,230
- What did he do?
- Of course he talked to them.

365
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,500
He was a really good teacher
who was concerned

366
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,040
- for his students.
- And then?

367
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,500
At first he said no matter
what happened,

368
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,000
he wouldn't make him transfer.

369
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,630
He promised.

370
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,650
- But then...
- Then?

371
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
It looked like he eventually
was convinced by the principal.

372
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,900
Saying something like if he
convinced Takeshi,

373
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
he would assure his future.

374
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,160
That's horrible...

375
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,270
What were we supposed to do?

376
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,170
When all the adults around you
betray you?

377
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,600
What can you do?

378
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,800
When you can't trust anyone?

379
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,170
Of course we'd go astray
like Takeshi...

380
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,180
Then he got into the motorcycle
accident?

381
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,580
They may call it an accident.

382
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,440
But to us, the adults killed him!

383
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,190
And Miyabi...

384
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,810
Until that incident...

385
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,110
she wasn't like she is now.

386
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,220
She was kind to everyone.

387
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,340
She was so thoughtful.

388
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,320
She was popular with everyone.

389
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,010
I want her back that way.

390
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,930
The real Miyabi,

391
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,330
I want her to return.

392
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,530
Murai-kun...

393
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,280
Could it be... you're...

394
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,000
So Miyabi, which do you think
I should wear

395
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,560
- to school tomorrow?
- Well, I think that one's better.

396
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,070
Really? It's not too flashy?

397
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,770
Not at all, Mom!
You're young and pretty.

398
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,730
Really? Okay then,
I'll wear this one!

399
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,600
Thanks Mom!

400
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,300
When I know that Onizuka will
be gone from tomorrow,

401
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,700
I can rest easy and study.

402
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,390
But you know, how many
homeroom teacher's is this?

403
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,990
Hasn't it been kind of a lot?

404
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,090
What do you expect?

405
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,280
They keep sending weirdos.

406
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,990
Can you give them an earful
about that too, tomorrow?

407
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,860
Yes, I'll do that.

408
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,750
Mama, you're the only one
I can count on.

409
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,170
I'll take care of it!

410
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,530
Yes, I think I'll wear this one...

411
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,950
Oh! I'm stuffed!

412
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,250
I feel like I don't have a worry
in the world!

413
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,650
Thank you very much
for the food, Sensei!

414
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,080
Hey! You gonna eat more?!

415
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,790
Mind your own business!

416
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,190
You're being a total pig!

417
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,720
Hey, look at them in a panic!
Tomorrow's fall session.

418
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,520
We used to do that too!

419
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,120
Cramming on the last day
of summer vacation.

420
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Yeah! Yeah!

421
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,420
Late the last night, our faces
would be all like this!

422
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,920
Man, was that ugly, wasn't it?

423
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,810
Fall session...

424
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,610
Okay! Now that our stomachs
are full, let's go somewhere!

425
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
I...

426
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,520
I want to go somewhere
far away.

427
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Huh?

428
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
Where no one knows us,

429
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,320
somewhere where there's
no one from our school.

430
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,160
Okay! I'll take you there!

431
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,120
Somewhere far away
with no one around!

432
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,300
Sheeze, what a lucky bastard,
out on a date

433
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,840
with two high school girls!

434
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,340
Idiot! This is the reason why
I became a teacher!

435
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,040
So, where's this place far away?

436
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,640
Just wait and see!

437
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,390
- So, which one's for you?
- What?

438
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,600
You know, which one're you
going to get it on with?

439
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,960
You know, you...

440
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,020
Hey, where're we going?

441
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,500
It better not be a love hotel!

442
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,330
Of course not! Here.

443
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,130
- What's this?
- Blindfolds.

444
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,800
- Oh, that's good!
- What for?

445
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,000
So when we get there,
it'll be a big surprise!

446
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,510
So you <i>are</i> going to take
them to a hotel.

447
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,610
Which one do you want to go to?
How about that one?

448
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,510
Dumb ass! Shut up and drive!

449
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,390
Okay! You can take
them off now!

450
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,870
How's this? Feels great,
doesn't it?

451
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,930
Yeah, feels great!

452
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Time for some calisthenics!

453
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,720
One, two!

454
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,700
One, two!

455
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,300
Chikako, Erika!

456
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,760
Doesn't this make you forget
everything?

457
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,490
Me too!

458
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,890
A long time ago,

459
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,000
when I'd get all pissed off
from fighting with my teacher,

460
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,380
I'd come here a lot and look
at the sunflowers.

461
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,970
- You're kidding me!
- Shaddap.

462
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,390
- Feels great, doesn't it?
- It really does!

463
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,520
Alright! Shall we run too?

464
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,340
- This is the best part.
- Butt out!

465
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,270
That Onizuka, he is out
playing after all!

466
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,000
Geeze!

467
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,700
What am I supposed to do!

468
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,280
What happened?
You seem awfully happy.

469
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,900
You see, from tomorrow,
that pest is finally

470
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,000
going to be gone.

471
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,030
When I think about how finally
the academy will return to normal,

472
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,830
I feel so much more relaxed.

473
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,830
Mama, which do you
think looks better?

474
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,330
Oh, that's nice!

475
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,330
- Could it be a date?
- You can tell?

476
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,520
So which do you think
Eikichi'll like?

477
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,530
I think that more skanky one,
it is Eikichi...

478
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,930
- What are you doing!
- Yoshiko!

479
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,440
I've told you, I won't allow you
to see that man!

480
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,400
- This doesn't concern you, Papa!
- I won't allow it!

481
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,900
This is like underwear!
What do you think'll happen

482
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,400
if you wear this in front of that
uncivilized man!

483
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,000
No matter what you say Papa,
my feelings for Eikichi

484
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,080
- won't change!
- Stupid!

485
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,790
I am no longer the old Papa,
you knew.

486
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,890
I'm not going to go easy on you
from now on!

487
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,700
Understand?

488
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,230
If you heard me,
then answer me!

489
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,070
I got it.

490
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,090
- That's good!
- I'm leaving.

491
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,000
What? Wait, Yoshiko!

492
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,890
Don't just stand there,
do something!

493
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,190
I can't do anything,
it was your fault.

494
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,900
But I did it because
I was worried about Yoshiko

495
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,290
being mislead by that man!

496
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,990
It's alright if Yoshiko
really loves him.

497
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,190
Do you know?

498
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,090
You don't know what kind
of man he is!

499
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,810
Yoshiko!

500
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,530
Sorry to have been such
a burden on you.

501
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,610
Don't be ridiculous!

502
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,510
I am now cutting our family ties.

503
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,520
Wait! Hold it!

504
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,920
Oh my, she's left.

505
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,450
Looks like she'll go to Eikichi.

506
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,150
She won't come back.

507
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,160
That Onizuka!

508
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,600
As long as he is alive,

509
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,540
my life will be in shambles!

510
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,200
So he's got girls over after all!

511
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
He's got no idea!

512
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,540
- Hey, you're gonna lose!
- Shaddap!

513
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,950
- Yeay!
- Won again!

514
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,450
Someone's really crappy
at this, isn't he?

515
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,450
Shaddap! Okay then.

516
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,450
Alright! How about
<i>shishi narabe</i>!

517
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,650
I'm good at that!

518
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,820
What's up? Scared of losing?

519
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,310
I...

520
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,620
- I want to go to school.
- Me too.

521
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,600
You know, before, if you said fall
session started tomorrow,

522
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,820
I would have not wanted
to go to school.

523
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,320
But now, I really want
to go to school.

524
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,220
Isn't that a first?

525
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,230
You know, I still can't believe it.

526
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,070
Everyone starts school
tomorrow,

527
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,550
and we can't go.

528
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,080
Well, we're going home.

529
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,170
Today's lesson was fun!

530
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,400
For us, all of today
was a lesson, wasn't it?

531
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,060
What are you guys
babbling 'bout?

532
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,910
Thank you, Sensei.

533
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,810
Good bye, Sensei.

534
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,170
<i>- How?</i>
- Thank you.

535
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,220
I see!

536
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,670
So this time, Onizuka-sensei
is really going to be fired?

537
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,400
No doubt about it!

538
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,300
Right now, the head teacher
is explaining the situation

539
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
to class 2-4 and their parents.

540
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
You know, I thought from
the beginning

541
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,500
that this would happen.

542
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,660
But, it's too bad.

543
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,710
Whatever they say, he still
was a good teacher.

544
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,380
But you know, he caused
too many problems.

545
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,680
If they'd tolerate those methods,
then even I might do that!

546
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,370
In our inquiries,

547
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,370
all the various problems
with the students of 2-4,

548
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,600
were due to Onizuka-sensei.

549
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,370
Although the students may have
forced the situation,

550
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,900
Onizuka-sensei's responsibility
was important.

551
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,270
It cannot be forgiven.

552
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,280
Therefore,

553
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,200
Onizuka-sensei will undergo
a disciplinary discharge.

554
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,600
There is the issue of both
Ôshima Chikako

555
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,370
and Tsukishima Erika.

556
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,200
We considered the seriousness
of their offenses.

557
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,500
It's been decided to expel
them from school.

558
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,970
As far as class 2-4's
homeroom teacher,

559
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,170
until a new teacher is assigned,
I will take over this class.

560
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,470
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

561
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,270
The students with problems
may not be at fault.

562
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,610
Those students may just be trying
to appeal their own feelings.

563
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,800
What if the students who
don't do anything

564
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,710
or cause any problems
have problems.

565
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,010
This doesn't concern you.

566
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,500
If you've got time for that,
shouldn't you

567
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,400
- worry about your own class?
- Excuse me.

568
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,930
- Head Teacher.
- Yes?

569
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,500
As guardians, our desire is for you
to provide a good environment

570
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,100
for our children study and enable
them to enter good universities.

571
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,900
That being said, teachers
like Onizuka-sensei

572
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,700
are a failure and of no use.

573
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,200
To just get rid of problem
students won't solve all problems.

574
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Please wait a moment!

575
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,010
What do you want?

576
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,150
Do you really know your
own daughter?

577
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,280
How rude, of course!

578
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,780
Then you know she was bullying
her classmates?

579
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,600
That she organized the boycott
and pressured

580
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,100
the other students to join in.

581
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,590
That all of this is due to some
past incident.

582
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,580
That because of that,
she no longer trusts adults?

583
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,080
What are you saying?

584
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,230
Saying things to suggest my
daughter has problems?

585
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,450
Head Teacher,
I demand an explanation!

586
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,510
I'm so sorry!

587
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,150
Fuyutsuki-sensei, apologize!

588
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,490
- Why?
- Just do it!

589
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,540
- I will not apologize!
- What is that attitude?

590
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,500
Aren't any of you concerned
that your classmates

591
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,780
are going to be expelled?

592
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,200
It'll be just the same as with
Takeshi-kun!

593
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,220
Or maybe,

594
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,040
you didn't care about what
would happen to him too?

595
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,770
- You snitched?
- Stay out of this.

596
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:46,170
Is this the schools way
to harass us the parents?

597
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,470
If that's so, then we
are prepared.

598
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,370
I'm terribly sorry, Fuyutsuki-
sensei was out of line.

599
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,470
Well then!

600
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,270
Please insure us that this will
never happen again.

601
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,300
Don't you realize it's teachers
like this that cause

602
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,980
- all these problems?
- But...

603
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,170
Trying to lay the blame
on the parents.

604
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,170
The teachers should reflect on
what they're saying themselves!

605
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,900
Have you ever seriously
considered your qualifications

606
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,280
to teach your students?

607
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,400
- We're always considering...
- You're always making excuses.

608
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,810
Listen, please deal with
the problem immediately!

609
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,500
That Onizuka! What's he up to!

610
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,750
What are you doing?

611
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,270
- Holding class, of course.
- What do you mean?

612
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,170
You are no longer one
of our teachers!

613
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,650
And you too, you are not our
students, leave now!

614
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
For those who want
to attend my class,

615
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
- I will do anything.
- What's that?

616
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
For example, even if the school
expels Chikako and Erika,

617
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,580
- they're my students.
- Don't be ridiculous!

618
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,280
This is totally irresponsible.

619
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,970
You can say whatever you want,
but your class has rejected you.

620
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,600
You're the one who's
messed up!

621
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,000
Chasing out the ones who want
to come to school,

622
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,700
and protecting the ones
who don't!

623
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,400
This is preposterous!
Head Teacher, call the police

624
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,660
- and have him removed!
- Go ahead, call whoever!

625
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,260
- This is enough, Onizuka!
- Stop it, Sensei!

626
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,230
It's enough already!

627
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,170
- I'm so embarrassed already.
- Me too.

628
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,460
More than not being able
to go to school,

629
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,670
that I did something so
stupid like that,

630
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,170
that's even more terrible!

631
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,850
When I think about what we did,

632
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,750
it makes me sick to the stomach.

633
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,260
Everyone,

634
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,760
you probably don't care about
what happens to us.

635
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,190
But you know...

636
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,800
If you lose Onizuka,
you'll regret it for sure!

637
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,000
When we were told we couldn't
come to school,

638
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,470
he really worried about us.

639
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,100
Onizuka stayed with us to figure
out what we should do.

640
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
He stayed by our sides.

641
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,230
He stayed and worried
with us, you know!

642
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,790
Is it alright to lose
a teacher like this?

643
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,060
Do you want to end up like us?

644
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,290
Now then, everyone,
please return.

645
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,020
Once we clear this,
your homeroom will begin.

646
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,190
Until then, go back.

647
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,090
What are you doing?

648
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,100
Do you understand what
you're doing?

649
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,650
Do you understand?

650
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,970
If you do this, you'll all
be expelled!

651
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,400
- Do you want that?
- Hold on a minute!

652
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,340
Just because they opposed
a teacher a little, you'll do this?

653
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,900
Does this school expel their
students that easily?

654
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,300
Yes, does it?

655
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,600
You see, our academy,
I'm responsible,

656
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,410
so it's my duty to enforce
the school rules and regulations.

657
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,100
I hope you understand this.

658
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,960
Are you saying they should just
mindlessly obey you?

659
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,810
Is every situation in this school
resolved that way?

660
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,410
What about the welfare
of the children?

661
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,900
You don't know a thing!

662
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,000
You don't understand what
we go through.

663
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,940
It's because of discipline
in the homes are lacking,

664
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,340
that cause these problems.

665
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,980
- How terrible!
- Hold on!

666
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,740
I will overlook what you just said.

667
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,370
But isn't it so?

668
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,670
When there's an incident,
it falls on the schools.

669
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,570
You may not realize it,
but the school gets it first.

670
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,900
But isn't it the parent's
responsibility?

671
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,100
No one expects the school to get
involved in home discipline.

672
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,300
All we want is you to raise
their grades

673
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,020
and get them into good colleges.

674
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,200
Don't you see,
that's the problem.

675
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Asking this of the teachers
without regard of their situation.

676
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,650
We're paying good tuition,
you're professionals, aren't you?

677
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,540
Of course we have requests
that we wish filled.

678
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:25,300
We can't just go around raising
a ruckus like you.

679
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,460
We have to face thirty students
single handed.

680
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,500
How ridiculous!

681
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,900
We parents are the ones who are
with the children their whole lives.

682
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,200
All teachers have to do is get
them to graduate.

683
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,960
Or like this time, when there's
trouble to just get rid of them.

684
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,370
If you don't like it, then go
to another school!

685
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,800
Wasn't it your suggestion,
that they be expelled.

686
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,500
Are you trying to shift the blame,
just because you

687
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,880
- have no management skills.
- What?!

688
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,860
- What're you doing?
- Go back.

689
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,540
What's the meaning of this?

690
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,750
Do you understand what
you're doing?

691
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,750
Don't you see?

692
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
You're being fooled by that man!

693
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,260
That's right! We're doing
this for you!

694
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,560
What do you plan to do,
Head Teacher?

695
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,110
Why don't you talk to them?

696
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,600
What? This is your place.

697
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,300
Now you're shifting the blame.
That's irresponsible.

698
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,880
- You're being irresponsible...
- Excuse me.

699
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,160
Could you do this outside,
you're disturbing my class.

700
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,480
Good morning, everyone.

701
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,640
This fall session,
let's make it great too!

702
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,230
Everyone returned?

703
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,460
Then there's no reason to have
Onizuka-sensei quit, is there?

704
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,360
- No.
- Why is that?

705
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,400
Aizawa Miyabi and Murai Kunio
have not returned.

706
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,680
The agreement was everyone,
Director.

707
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,580
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

708
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
What are you doing here?

709
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,600
Aizawa Miyabi is calling
in absent today.

710
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,670
- What's that?
- If you'll excuse me I have class.

711
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,400
So it was no good.

712
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,800
That PTA president
was useless too.

713
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,600
And I had my hopes up,
it seemed that the head teacher

714
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,700
had changed a bit too.

715
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,440
I figured something like this
would happen.

716
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,500
<i>Saying it's for the children,
it's for the children,</i>

717
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,400
<i>but what they do is really only
because they're concerned</i>

718
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,000
<i>for their own position.
That's what's wrong with both</i>

719
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,800
<i>teachers and the parents.
Am I wrong?</i>

720
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,100
<i>Have I said anything wrong?</i>

721
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,910
<i>So why doesn't anyone
do as I say?</i>

722
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,990
Idiot.

723
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,510
So Ôshima-san and Tsukishima-
san don't have to quit?

724
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,610
Bingo!

725
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,310
- The director just approved it.
- I'm glad!

726
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,410
- Thanks for everything!
- For what?

727
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,270
You know, you tried so hard
during the hearing.

728
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,970
I didn't really do anything.

729
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,800
Everyone said you'd become like
a hot blooded teacher!

730
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,520
Oh, stop it!

731
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,640
You did it for me, didn't you?

732
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,610
You!

733
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,010
I was just concerned about
Ôshima-san.

734
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,210
Hold it!

735
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,130
Let's not get into the usual
fight pattern.

736
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,830
We should celebrate today.

737
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,620
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Hey! Great idea!

738
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,100
Hm, didn't take much
convincing...

739
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,540
What's that? I'm always
being sincere!

740
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,710
- What's wrong, Tomoko?
- Sensei.

741
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,820
- I...
- Yes?

742
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,800
I...

743
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,920
- I'm going to quit school.
- What?!

744
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
2016-06

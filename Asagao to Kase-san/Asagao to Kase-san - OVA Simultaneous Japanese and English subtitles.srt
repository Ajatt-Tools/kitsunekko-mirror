00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,490
私達は女の子同士だけど
Even though we're both girls...

3
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,330
山田（やまだ）もB組！　私と一緒！
Yamada, you're in Class B! Same as me!

4
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,010
よかった！
Thank goodness!

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,580
かせ　ともか
Tomoka Kase

6
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,660
あ、私もだ
Hey, me too!

7
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
この間から付き合い始めました
We started going out a short while ago.

8
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,250
曇りがちで　はっきりしないお天気が続きましたが　次第に流れが変わってきました
...we saw cloudy skies and some showers,
but conditions have improved since.

9
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,600
明日以降は　爽やかな快晴が続く見込みです
Tomorrow's conditions look to be clear and refreshing.

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,170
それでは　三人…
In other news...

11
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,610
あー　加瀬（かせ）さん！
Whoa! It's Kase-san!

12
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,210
な…なんだろう
W-What did she write...?

13
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,330
Can I call you?

14
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,330
Can I call you?

15
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,330
Can I call you?

16
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,330
Can I call you?

17
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,550
い…い…よ
Go... ahead..

18
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,500
もしもし　山田です！
H-Hello?! Yamada speaking!

19
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,310
え…　知ってる
Uh... yeah, I know!

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
こっちは加瀬だよ
This is Kase.

21
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,650
うん　知ってる
Yeah, I know.

22
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,450
そうだよね　なんだかつい身構えちゃって
Right, I was... kinda bracing myself.

23
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,180
なんで身構えんのさ
You don't have to brace yourself!

24
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,630
いま　何してた？
What are you up to?

25
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,830
いま？　さっきお風呂に入って　今は…
Me? I just took a bath, and now I'm, uh...

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,650
えっとね　緑の本読んでる
Reading a book about greenery.

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,290
緑の？
Greenery...?

28
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,000
あぁ
Oh!

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
ところで　ね、加瀬さん
By the way, um, Kase-san...

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,610
うん　何？
Yeah? What's up?

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,200
私　実はあんまり…　っていうか…
I've never really, or, like...

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,450
男子と喋ったことほとんどないし　その…
I barely even talked to guys or anything. So...

33
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,000
つ…付き合う人は加瀬さんが初めてなんだけど
You're the first person I've gone out with.

34
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,350
こ…高３にもなって恥ずかしいよね　だけどわかんなくて
For a high school senior, that's bad enough,
but I've got no clue what...

35
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,780
いや　別に恥ずかしいとか　そんなこと全然
No, t-that's nothing to be embarrassed about!

36
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,000
でも
But...

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
ふつう付き合ってるカップルは　なんか　色々するんだよね
Couples usually do all sorts of things together, so...

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,600
なんの音？　も…もしもし？
What was that sound? H-Hello?

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
もしもーし？
Hello?!

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,900
あれ
Uh...

41
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,420
いや　なんでも
Don't worry. It's nothing.

42
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,130
大丈夫？　なんだか息苦しそうだよ　加瀬さん
Are you okay? Your voice sounds kinda stifled...

43
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,130
トレーニングも大事だけど　無理しちゃやだよ
Training is important and all,
but you shouldn't push yourself!

44
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
加瀬さん？
K-Kase-san?!

45
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,750
大丈夫　平気平気
I'm alright! Don't you worry.

46
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,750
ほ…本当？　よかった…
For real? That's a relief.

47
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,650
それでね　具体的に私　何をすればいいと思う？
So I mean, is there something specific I'm supposed to do in a relationship?

48
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,250
え…と…
Ah, geez...

49
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,650
もしもし　加瀬さん？
Hey, Kase-san?

50
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
加瀬さん？！
Kase-san?!

51
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,030
や…山田
Y-Yamada...

52
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,000
山田の好きなようにでいいよ
Do whatever you wanna do, Yamada.

53
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,540
それでいいの？
Is that really okay?

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,800
うん
Yep!

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
なんだ　そっか
So that's how it works!

56
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,200
うんうん　じゃね　おやすみ
Don't sweat it. I'll see ya soon! Goodnight!

57
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,650
私と
Will you...

58
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,900
ダメじゃないです
I will.

59
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,200
付き合ってくれる？
...go out with me?

60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,150
全然ダメじゃないです！
Of course I will!

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,780
ダメだったらごめん…　私…
I'm sorry if I'm forcing this on you...

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
私もずっと　そういうの思ってました
It's just... I've always felt the same way...

63
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,050
付き合ってるなんて
Dating her...

64
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,410
夢みたい
Am I dreaming?

65
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,450
私は今　加瀬さんと両思い！
And our feelings for each other are mutual!

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,390
もう　どうしよう
Aah, I can't believe it!

67
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,750
山田の好きなようにでいいよ
Do whatever you wanna do, Yamada.

68
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,500
付き合うって
Relationships...

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,850
思ったより　ふわっとしてるものなんだな…
feel more vague than I expected.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
でも　こういう時はやっぱり
But at times like these, I can always...

71
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,550
手作りのお弁当でしょ！
make her a homemade lunch!

72
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,820
え？！　加瀬さん休み？
Wait, did Kase-san take a day off?

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,680
いや　陸上のなんかで急に呼び出されて　どっか行くって
No, they needed her for some track and field stuff,
so she had to go somewhere.

74
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,330
休みだよ　それ！
That's pretty much the same!

75
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,500
もう今日は寝たい
I'll sleep through the day.

76
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,900
そこで寝んの？
On the floor?

77
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,450
初沖縄！　飛行機初めて！
It's my first visit to Okinawa!
And first time on a plane!

78
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,540
はいはい　静かに
Alright, now. Quiet down.

79
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,630
今からそんな浮かれてると　いざ当日になって力尽きる運命が待ってるんですよ
If you get too excited now, you're destined
to have no energy left when it's time to go!

80
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,850
若さがあれば平気でーす
That's no problem when you're young!

81
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,810
同じく！
You tell her!

82
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,750
あなた達…
Okay, girls...

83
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,150
誰かを挑発してるのかしら？
Are you trying to provoke a certain someone?

84
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,200
たぎってくる！
Hook, line, and sinker!

85
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,650
ね　山田？
Right, Yamada?

86
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
おう！
Boo!

87
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,820
今日も頑張ってるな　緑化委員？
Workin' hard today, Ms. Gardener?

88
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,600
なんだ　三河っち（みかわっち）か
Oh, it's you, Mikawacchi.

89
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,550
なんだとは何さ　変なため息ついてるから活入れてあげたじゃん
What do you mean, "it's you"? You made
an odd sigh so I'm cheering you up.

90
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,790
ため息？
Sigh?

91
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,700
私がいま…？
Was I sighing?

92
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,800
んじゃまたね　バーイ！
I'll see ya tomorrow! Bye!

93
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,000
ため息　ついてた？
Was I sighing?

94
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,450
いや　頑張ろう！
No! Stay focused!

95
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,100
あ！　ため息！
Whoa! I sighed!

96
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,380
山田　おはよう！
Morning, Yamada!

97
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
おはよう　加瀬さん
Good morning, Kase-san!

98
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,260
あの…　あのね
You know, I...

99
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,340
えっと…
I, um...

100
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,010
どこ…
Where is it?

101
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,450
おかよう　加瀬！
Good morning, Kase!

102
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,560
いってー　何よいきなり？
Hey, what's the big idea?

103
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
加瀬いなくて　昨日つまんなかったじゃん
It was super boring without you around!

104
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,390
てか　一緒にD組来てよ
Come on over to Class D with us!

105
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,690
鈴木のやつ　今週中に部誌の記事書くって言っといて　何もしてないんだよ
Suzuki said she'd finish the article for our club's
magazine this week, but she's totally slacking!

106
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,790
はー？　まだやってないの？
Dang, she still hasn't done it?

107
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,890
私も言ったんだけどさ…
I reminded her and everything!

108
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,000
いやもう　加瀬からガツンと言ってやって！
Go talk some sense into her, Kase!

109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,550
加瀬さん人気だね
Kase-san sure is popular.

110
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,540
あぁ　うん
Yeah, I guess.

111
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,460
まあいっか
That's okay.

112
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,000
お昼になってから言えば
I'll give it to her at lunch.

113
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,400
山田！　お昼食べよう！
Let's have lunch, Yamada!

114
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,450
あ…あのね　今日は加瀬さんも一緒に
Um, is it okay if Kase-san joins us today?

115
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,840
加瀬さんなら　陸上部の人と学食行ったよ
Kase-san's eating with the track and field girls in the cafeteria.

116
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,820
え？！
What?!

117
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,000
また寝るんかい？
You gonna sleep again?

118
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,450
山田さ　もしかして
Hey Yamada, don't tell me...

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,560
加瀬さんと付き合ってる？
you're going out with Kase-san?

120
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,900
な…なんで？
W-Why—

121
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,350
なんとなく
Kinda seems that way.

122
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,850
ていうか弁当二人分だし
Come to think of it, that's a lunch for two...

123
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,000
えっと…
Well...

124
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,500
こ…これは…
I-It's...

125
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,300
言ってよ！
You coulda told me!

126
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,330
ごめん…　けど　なんか…
Sorry, it's just a bit...

127
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,750
はい
Here.

128
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,510
私にはわからんけど　相方が超人気物って大変なんだろうね
I don't completely understand, but I bet
it's tough being with someone that popular.

129
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,150
でも　山田はめげない
But that doesn't seem to bother ya.

130
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,500
あれ　残ってなかった？
Wait, there was nothing left?

131
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,200
あぁ　ごめん！　今度なんかおごるわ
Sorry! I'll treat you to something next time!

132
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,850
あれ　なんで残したの？
Huh? You didn't eat?

133
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,000
加瀬さん！
Kase-san!

134
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,450
うっま
Yum!

135
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,850
おいしかったー！　ごちそうさま
That was delicious! Thanks a bunch!

136
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,100
ごめんね　山田がお弁当作ってくれてたなんて　思いもよらなくて
Sorry. I had no idea you made a lunch just for me.

137
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,000
いつもドタバタしてて落ち着かないよね　私
I'm always running around,
so it's probably hard to catch up.

138
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,050
ううん　加瀬さん優しいしかっこいいし
みんな加瀬さんを好きになるのは　当たり前だよ
Well, it's because you're so nice and cool!
Of course everyone wants to be around you.

139
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,370
山田？
Yamada?

140
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,890
そっか…　私こうやって大事なものに気づかないってこと　たくさんあったんだろうな
True. Maybe all that busywork lead to
me neglecting what I value the most...

141
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,800
来て！
C'mon!

142
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,000
こっち！
This way!

143
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,010
ここ　下見て
Here. Look down.

144
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,900
植え込み？
Shrubbery?

145
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,000
二年のときさ
From second year.

146
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,750
休憩時間も草むしりしてたでしょ
You'd spend lunches down there weeding, right?

147
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,450
多分　お弁当あとの残り１０分ぐらいなのに
Even though you only had ten minutes after eating...

148
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,250
植え込みの下をずっと　西から東
Head buried in the shrubbery, moving west to east...

149
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,180
雨の日は　黄緑色の傘
On rainy days, you'd bring a lime-green umbrella.

150
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,650
晴れの日は　麦わら帽子
And a straw hat when it was sunny.

151
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,950
いつも　すごいなーって見てた
You never failed to impress me.

152
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,280
振り向いてくれないかなって思いながら
I was always wondering if you'd turn around.

153
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,010
なのに　全然上見てくれないの
But you never bothered to look up.

154
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,210
こっちはずっと見てんのにさ
Even though I was always watching you.

155
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,050
やでしょ？
Creepy, eh?

156
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,710
私　ストーカーなの！
Now I sound like some sort of stalker!

157
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,600
ずっと！
Always...

158
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,000
緑化委員ストーカーなの！
stalking the gardener!

159
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,060
加瀬さん…
Kase-san...

160
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,000
でも　やっと目が合った
But eventually, our eyes met.

161
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,140
ここで
Right here.

162
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,200
うん！
Yep!

163
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
私と加瀬さんは
Kase-san and I...

164
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,000
この春から付き合っています
started dating this spring.

165
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,800
私は　園芸が趣味の緑化委員ですが
Gardening is my hobby, and I'm in the planting committee.

166
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,550
加瀬さんは　インターハイに３年連続で出場する
Kase-san's ran in the Inter-high three years in a row.

167
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,250
陸上部のエース
She's the star of the track club.

168
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,040
私は　初めて付き合うのが加瀬さんなので
Kase-san is the first person I've ever dated,

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,770
女の子同士ということより
so even if we're both girls, I...

170
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,990
大好きすぎて
I love her so much

171
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
どうしていいか　わかりません
that I don't know what to do.

172
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,310
山田！
Yamada!

173
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,660
今日空いてる？
You free today?

174
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,850
今日の部活　ミーティングだけになったから早く帰れそうなんだけど
Our club's only having a meeting today,
so it looks like I can go home early.

175
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,800
そうなんだ　珍しいね
Huh, that's unusual!

176
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,700
じゃ　うちに来る？
Wanna come over?

177
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,310
えー　いいの？！
Huh?! You sure?

178
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:25,550
うん！　今日　ちょうどお父さんもお母さんも帰りが遅くてね　私一人で寂しいと思ってたんだ
Yep! My mom and dad are gonna be home late,
and I think I'd feel lonely all by myself.

179
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,250
そ…そう　じゃあ　そうしよっか
R-Really? I'll come on over, then.

180
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,920
やった！
Yay!

181
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,000
じゃ…　じゃあ　一回うちに荷物を置いていくから
O-Okay! I'll come after I drop my stuff off at home.

182
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,450
うん　じゃあ　また後でね
Sure, see you later!

183
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,500
いってっ
Ouch!

184
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,580
加瀬さん？！
Kase-san?!

185
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,180
うん　平気平気
Don't worry! I'll be fine.

186
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,300
どうしたんだろう　急に
What was that all about?

187
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
まあいっか
Oh well!

188
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
そう　早く帰って準備準備
I better go and get everything ready.

189
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,740
では　最終確認
Time for the final check!

190
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
メールなし　すなわち時間の変更なし
No emails, meaning no changes in schedule!

191
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,300
部屋の掃除よし
Room's clean!

192
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,580
机の上よし
Desk's tidy!

193
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,540
ファブリックよーし
Fabrics cleaned!

194
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,360
うん　準備万端
Okay! We're all good!

195
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,000
あとは加瀬さんが来るのを待つのみ
All that's left is waiting for Kase-san to come.

196
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,190
部屋で加瀬さんと二人っきりって
Alone in my room with Kase-san...

197
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,150
ちょっと
This might be...

198
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,280
すごいことなのかも
something totally amazing?

199
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,860
はーい？
Yes?

200
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,500
こ…こんちは！
S... 'Sup?

201
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,650
加瀬さん！
Kase-san!

202
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,830
いらっしゃい！　迷わず来れた？
Come on in! Did you have trouble finding the place?

203
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,870
大丈夫
Not at all!

204
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,000
何度もマップでチェックしてたしすぐにわかっ
I kept on checking the map, so I always knew...

205
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,300
マップ？　なんだ　じゃ大丈夫だね
A map? No wonder you didn't get lost.

206
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,550
あ　これ買ってきたんだ
Um, this is for you!

207
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,950
ケーキ？
Cake?

208
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,010
一緒に食べよう
Wanna share?

209
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,000
うん！
Yeah!

210
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,700
ちょっと散らかってるけど　どうぞ
It might be a bit messy, but come on in.

211
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,430
お…おじゃましまーす
T-Thank you...

212
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,300
なんだか照れくさいけど
It's kinda embarrassing, but...

213
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,200
はい！
Here!

214
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,300
はい？
For me?

215
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,440
お茶入れてくるから座っててね
I'll go pour us some tea, so sit tight!

216
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,590
あぁ　うん
Um, sure...

217
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,250
加瀬さんが私の部屋にいるなんて
I can't believe Kase-san is in my room!

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,010
やっぱちょっと照れちゃう
I'm probably blushing up a storm!

219
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,610
でも　嬉しいなー
I'm so happy!

220
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,980
おまたせ
Sorry for the wait!

221
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,050
どうしたの？　どっか具合でも？
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

222
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,370
いや　大丈夫　大丈夫！
No, no, I'm fine!

223
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,100
ちょっとベッドがふかふかだったもんね
Your bed looked super fluffy, so...

224
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,800
な…なんだ…
W-Whew...

225
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,840
山田の部屋　色んな本があるね
You've practically got a library in here.

226
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,240
あ　これ全部英語だ
Wow, this one's all in English.

227
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,300
それはナショナルトラストの本　イギリスの環境保護のボランティア
That's a National Trust book.
They're a conservationist group in England.

228
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,000
イギリスはガーデナーの聖地だよ
England is the Mecca of gardening.

229
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,180
いつか行ってみたいと思ってるんだ
I'd love to go there someday!

230
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,390
えー　イギリス行くの山田？　移住？！
Will you move to England, Yamada?!

231
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,400
いや　英語できないし無理無理　旅行できたらいいなーって
No, I can't even speak any English!
I just think it'd be a nice place to visit.

232
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,240
すごいね　山田って
You're amazing, Yamada.

233
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,200
えっ　そんなこと…
Huh? Not at all...

234
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,620
ケーキ食べよう　ね？
Let's have some cake!

235
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,800
ショートケーキ！
Shortcake!

236
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,000
はい山田　あげる　好きでしょ？
Have mine, Yamada. You like 'em, don't you?

237
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,150
す…好きだけど
I-I like them, but...

238
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,050
苺はケーキの命だよ
Strawberries are the heart of cake!

239
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,550
うるさいなー
Oh, come on!

240
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,260
はい　あーん
Say "Aah"!

241
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,360
あーん
Aah!

242
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,190
おいしい？
Was it good?

243
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,010
私もここで食ーべよっと
I wanna eat over here, too!

244
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,790
本当に好きなんだね　苺ショート
You really love your strawberry shortcakes, huh?

245
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
うん！
Mm!

246
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,650
山田？
Yamada?

247
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,400
ん？
Mm?

248
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,550
山田は…　その…
Yamada, do you...

249
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,350
私と
want to...

250
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,480
してもいいと思ってる？
do it with me?

251
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,000
どっち？
How about it?

252
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,490
キス？
A kiss?

253
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
キス…かな？
A kiss, right?

254
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,740
えっと
Um...

255
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,500
う…うん
W-Well...

256
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,450
いいよ　加瀬さんがしたいなら
If you want to, Kase-san, we can...

257
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,200
あっ　でも待ってね　これ飲んじゃうから
Just give me a sec! I'll finish this up!

258
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,010
山田わかってないでしょ
You just don't get it, Yamada.

259
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,400
ごめん　山田が部屋に読んでくれたから私　勝手に浮かれちゃった
My bad. I must've got the wrong idea
when you invited me to your room.

260
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,940
わ…わかってるよ
No, I get it!

261
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,680
嘘　わかってない
Liar. You don't know a thing.

262
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
嘘じゃないよ　本当にわかってるよ　私
I'm not lying! I really do know what you mean!

263
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,330
私も加瀬さんと
If it's with you, I'll...

264
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,500
本当に　山田？
Are you sure, Yamada?

265
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,920
私　山田とちゃんと付き合いたいんだ
I want to be closer to you.

266
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,430
ちゃんと
Closer.

267
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,720
ちゃんと？
Closer?

268
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,000
ちゃんとって？
What's this...?

269
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,670
加瀬さん　いい匂い
Kase-san smells really nice.

270
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,440
なんだっけ　ハーブの
What was it... Something herbal...

271
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,940
あれ　ハーブの…
Huh, what herb was it...

272
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,490
もしもし？
Hello?

273
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,340
うん　家にいるよ
I'm home now.

274
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,000
うん　うん　友達が来ててね　ケーキもらった
Yeah, well... I invited a friend over. She brought cake.

275
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,670
え？　お礼？
Huh? Thanks?

276
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,970
もう　ちゃんと言ったってば
Of course I thanked her!

277
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,720
うん　もうわかってますってば
Right. Yeah, yeah, I know!

278
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,000
うん　うん
Yup. Of course.

279
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,850
はーい　それじゃあね
Thanks. See you later!

280
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,200
お母さんからだった　もうすぐ帰るって
That was just my mom. She's on her way home.

281
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,700
な…なに？
W-What...?

282
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,350
びっくりした　なにそれ音量マックス？
I almost had a heart attack.
Is the volume at max or something?

283
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
そ…そんなことなっ
I don't think s...

284
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,450
あったみたい
Guess it was.

285
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,290
山田
Yamada.

286
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,500
ここ　ここ座って
C'mere. Have a seat.

287
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,350
いたっ
Ow!

288
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,310
どー！
Boom!

289
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,520
また今度しよう
We'll do it next time.

290
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,270
こ…今度？
N-Next time?

291
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,040
はー　今日は早く帰れたよかった
I'm so glad I was able to leave early today!

292
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,600
すっごく嬉しい
I'm overjoyed.

293
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
今夜は眠れないかも
I don't know how I'll sleep tonight!

294
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,710
そういえば　加瀬さんって何かつけてる？　すごくいい匂い
By the way, are you wearing some kind of perfume?
You smell really nice.

295
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,630
ご…ごめん　やっぱ汗臭い？
Sorry! Do I, like, reek of sweat?

296
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,600
全然　そうじゃなくて
No, not like that!

297
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,000
さっきその…　ふわっていい香りしたから
It was this nice and airy scent...

298
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,880
ハーブの…　あっ　レモングラスみたいな
Like a herb... Lemongrass, maybe?

299
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
レモン？
Lemon?

300
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,390
これかな？
Maybe this?

301
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,800
いつも部活の後に使ってんのは　制汗剤
I always use this deodorant after club business.

302
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,080
手出して
Give me your hand.

303
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,060
ひゃっ　つめたっ！
Whew, that's cold!

304
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,980
あっ　これ　この香りだよ加瀬さん
That's it, Kase-san! It was this smell!

305
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,010
レモングラス！
Lemongrass!

306
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,250
少しこうしてていい　山田？
Do you mind if we stay like this for a bit, Yamada?

307
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,010
うん
No.

308
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
レモングラスの香りは
That sweet smell of lemongrass

309
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,260
私にも
came over me

310
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,100
ずっと残っていました
and forever lingered.

311
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,690
那覇空港には　午前十時到着予定です
Our plane is expected to land at Naha Airport by 10 AM.

312
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,780
空が…！
We're in the sky!

313
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,580
飛んでる！　ねっ　飛んでるよ飛行機！
We're flying! Our plane is actually flying!

314
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,950
しかもジュース付きだ！
And there's juice, too!

315
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,120
どうしよう　飛行機すごく楽しいかも！
I never knew planes would be this much fun!

316
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,550
ねっ　三河っち？
How d'ya like it, Mikawacchi?

317
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,710
あれ？　もうシートベルト外していいんだよ
You can take your seatbelt off now, you know.

318
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,480
外したくない　しかしもはや外さないわけにはいっ
I don't wanna. But I also really, really have to...

319
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,920
三河っち？　大丈夫？
Everything OK, Mikawacchi?

320
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,520
トットットットイレー
Where's the b-b-b-bathroom?!

321
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,310
大丈夫かな…
Is she gonna be alright?

322
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,560
おー！　これめっちゃトロピカル！
Man, it ain't tropical for nothin'!

323
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,610
—　なになに？
— トロピカルなオレンジと紅茶ブレンド　うっめー！
What's up?
This tropical orange juice tea blend is the bomb!

324
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,010
意味わかんねー
You sure about that?

325
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,310
いやマジ　ハワイイ感じんだって
No, seriously! Feels like Hawaii!

326
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,570
なんかこういうの苦手
This is a bit much for me...

327
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,750
音楽でも引きこもっていよう
Maybe I can drown them out with some music.
I swear!

328
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
いえいえいえ　本当に

329
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,450
嘘だと思ったら飲んでみろよ
If you think I'm lying, then have a taste!

330
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,550
うっせーなー　貸してみ
Shut up and hand it over.

331
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,300
ねっ　山田山田　ちょっと一緒に来てみてよ
Yo, can I borrow you for a sec?
I wanna show ya something.

332
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,600
か…加瀬さん？
K-Kase-san?

333
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
あっ　あのっ　加瀬さん
Kase-san, what...

334
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,780
ここだよ　ほら！
Right here! Look!

335
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,520
ね　すごいっ
Isn't it aweso—

336
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,130
すごい！　すごいね！
This is... This is amazing!

337
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,510
空の上っていつでも晴れてるんだよ　加瀬さん知ってた？
When you're high up in the sky, it's always sunny!
Did you know that, Kase-san?

338
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,930
えっ　うん　知ってたかな…
Y-Yeah, I think I might have...

339
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:50,200
やなことがあった日も　ウジウジしちゃった日も　お花が枯れちゃった日も
Even on your bad days, your anxious days,
or the days your flowers are wilting,

340
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,120
空の上ではずっとずっと晴れてるの！
the sun keeps shining way up in the sky above.

341
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,000
そう思うと　これからも頑張れるような気がする
You can't let anything get you down when you think about it!

342
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,970
しない？！
Am I right?!

343
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,000
うん　する
Yeah. You're right.

344
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,020
この間さ　地区予選で１位とった時に
他校のチームからクレームつけられたことがあってさ
When I took first place at the regional qualifiers,
it was contested by another school's team.

345
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,550
隣のレーンの子が転んじゃってね
The girl on a lane next to mine fell over.

346
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,670
私が足を引っ掛けたんじゃないかって
They were claiming that I might've tripped her.

347
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,000
審判とも色々もめて　結局走り直しになちゃって
They gave a ref a real hard time,
so they made us all run again.

348
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,440
まっ　結果は変わらなかったんだけどさ
But that didn't change a thing.

349
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,550
みんな必死だしさ　わかるんだ
I get it. Everyone's desperate.

350
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,540
けど　ね…
Ya know?

351
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,520
でも
Still...

352
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,280
この空見てたら　どうでも良くなちゃった
Seeing the sky like this made me forget all about it.

353
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,340
どんなことがあっても　ここはずっと晴れてるから　ね？
'Cause no matter how dark things get,
I know it's always sunny up here!

354
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,000
すごーい！　空の色が全然ちがうよ！
This is incredible! The color of the sky is totally different!

355
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,900
ハイビスカス　もう咲いてるんだ！
Hibiscus are already blooming!

356
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,000
生きててよかった
I made it out alive!

357
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,530
あっ　三河っち
Oh hey, Mikawacchi!

358
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,080
何いきなり撮ってんのよ
Don't take photos out of the blue!

359
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,260
げんきになっちぇよかっしゃ
（元気になってよかった）
Imjussfladyerfine!

360
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,800


361
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,600
かわいい…
So cute!

362
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,550
生き返る～
I am reborn!

363
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,030
はい山田
Have a bite, Yamada!

364
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,370
おいしい！
Delish!

365
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,500
あっ　ごめんね　はい
Oh, sorry! Here!

366
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,030
甘酸っぱい！
Sweet and sour!

367
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,790
ずっ
Boom.

368
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,540
三河　いつの間に
Mikawa, have you been—

369
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,360
まあまあまあ　写真なら私が撮ってあげるよ
Don't mind me! Lemme get a nice picture of you two.

370
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,740
はいチーズ
Say "Cheese"!

371
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,520
山田！
Yamada!

372
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,680
なんかお揃いで買ってこうよ
Souvenirs
We should get something that matches!

373
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,060
うん　なんかずっと持ち歩けるような　小物みたいなのがいいかも
Maybe small trinkets we could keep on us?
It'd be nice to have something like that.

374
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,520
わおオトメ
A pure maiden!

375
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,560
乙女じゃダメなの？
Is there a problem with that?

376
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,020
可もなく不可もなく
Maybe, maybe not.

377
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,430
なにそれ
You're so mean!

378
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,690
あっ　加瀬いた！
Hey, Kase's here!

379
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,570
後輩のお土産選ぶの手伝ってよ
Help us pick out souvenirs for the underclassmen!

380
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,520
うん　今行く
I'll be right there!

381
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,500
ごめん　あとで連絡するね
Sorry. I'll text you after.

382
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,790
うん
Okay!

383
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,290
加瀬さんとは　ホテルの部屋は別々です
Kase-san and I were in separate hotel rooms.

384
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,420
見て　オーシャンビュー！
Our room has a view of the ocean!

385
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,140
私こっちのベッドもーらい！
I call this bed!

386
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,500
ずるい！
How sneaky!

387
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,900
ふかふかオーシャンビュー
So fluffy, and with a view to die for!

388
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,220
イエーイ！
Yay!

389
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,600
もう…
Jeesh.

390
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,140
三河っちが一緒で嬉しい
I'm happy to share a room with Mikawacchi,

391
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,100
けど　本当は加瀬さんも一緒がよかったな
but I would honestly prefer to be with Kase-san.
I'm gonna use the bath!

392
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,060
Women

393
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,780
やたっ　空いてるじゃん！
Yay, it's empty!

394
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,000
わはー　キレーだね！
Ooh, this is nice!

395
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,240
Kase-san: On my way

396
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,240
Kase-san: On my way

397
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,960
なんで？！
Why?!

398
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,340
あいつらのお土産何した？
So what did you girls get as souvenirs?

399
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,460
ちんすーなんとか
Those chinsu-thingies.

400
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,390
か…加瀬さんと一緒にお風呂…
B-Bathing together with Kase=san...

401
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,560
今更なに言ってんのさ
It's too late to worry about it now.

402
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,240
私先行ってるからねー
I'll be in there if you need me!

403
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,450
ここのお風呂すごい広くない？
This bath is gigantic!

404
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,880
よーし競争だ！
How about a race?

405
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,370
泳ぐなよ
It's not for swimming...

406
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,650
山田　やっぱり私が一緒だと入りづらい？
Are you that uncomfortable with us bathing together?

407
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,950
運動部はさ　みんなで着替えとかシャワーとかふつうだけど
In track club, we're all expected
to change and shower together...

408
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,650
山田がそういうの苦手なら
But if you're not comfortable with that...

409
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,800
あまり　み…見ないようにするからさ
I'll t-try not to stare...

410
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,900
—　加瀬　入んないの?
You coming, Kase?

411
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,060
—　風呂なら負けないぜ！
I won't lose in the bath, either!

412
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,540
—　泳ぐなよ！
Seriously, don't swim!

413
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,840
うるさいなー　今行くよ
Would you be quiet?! I'm coming, okay?

414
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,850
先入ってるね
See you inside.

415
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,780
部屋のお風呂入ろう
I'll just use my room's bath...

416
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,360
We've got free time tomorrow,
so how about we sneak away together?

417
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,900
えっと…
Umm...

418
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,260
明日会って話そう
I'll wait and talk to her tomorrow.

419
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,580
明日
Tomorrow...

420
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,650
もう　私ってばもう
Jeez, I'm just... Jeez...

421
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,190
On my way

422
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,190
On my way

423
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,190
On my way

424
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,000
どうして　山田
Why, Yamada?

425
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,550
えー　この後は班ごとの自由行動ですが　はぐれる人が出ないように
Alright, you're free to go anywhere you want.
Just make sure to stay with your group.

426
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,010
では解散
Off you go.

427
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,130
ちょって来て
Come with me.

428
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,110
あっ

429
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,000
そんなに泣かないでよ　山田
There's no need to cry, Yamada.

430
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,820
私　フラれたかな？
Are you dumping me?

431
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,980
私の裸見て
You saw my nude body...

432
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,710
私　山田に嫌われちゃったのかなって
and came to loathe me for it?

433
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,670
たまにあるんだ
It's happened before.

434
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,000
仲良くしてた子が　体育の着替えの後とか　急によそよそしくなったりするの
Like in PE, a friend would grow distant
from me after we got changed together...

435
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,080
きっと　山田もそんなふうに
That has to be it.

436
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,050
違う！
No!

437
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,360
あれは　私びっくりしちゃったんだよ
That was... I was surprised, that's all!

438
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,000
いつも服着た加瀬さんしか見てないから　びっくりして
I'd never seen you without your clothes on,
so I was surprised!

439
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,000
私はぷよぷよだし　恥ずかしくて
And I got shy about how I'm flabby all around...

440
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,600
一緒にお風呂入れなかったんだよ
I couldn't work up the courage to bathe with you!

441
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,370
だから違うの　加瀬さん
So that's not it, Kase-san!

442
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,560
ごめん　ごめんね…
Sorry... I'm sorry...

443
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,010
加瀬さん？
Kase-san?

444
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,030
なんだ…
That's all?

445
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,150
よかったー！
What a relief!

446
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,610
また一緒に来ようよ
Let's come back someday.

447
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,280
沖縄　今度は二人だけで
To Okinawa. Just the two of us.

448
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,990
うん！
Sure!

449
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,870
約束
It's a promise.

450
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,000
加瀬さんと拾った珊瑚は
The coral I found with Kase-san...

451
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,990
夏の香りがしました
smelled of summer.

452
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,000
今週は　曇りや雨が続きそうです　お出かけの際は
Clouds and rain will likely continue
throughout the week. When you go out...

453
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,280
はい？
Hello?

454
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
あっ　どうも
Oh, hey.

455
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,110
お久しぶりです
It's been a while.

456
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,950
えーっと　あっ　ちょうど今から話してくるんですよ
Um, yeah, we're gonna talk about that now.

457
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,240
はい
Yeah.

458
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,270
ほんっともう　緊張しますよ先輩
Really, yeah. I'm super nervous.

459
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,350
山田さん　清玉（せいぎょく）なら問題なく受かると思いますけど
I think Yamada could get into Seigyoku no problem.

460
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,710
そうですか
I see!

461
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,500
英語をもう少し上げておけば万全よね
With a little more English practice, she'll be all set.

462
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,070
ありがとうございます
Thank you so much.

463
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,200
頑張らなきゃね　結衣（ゆい）
Keep at it, eh, Yui?

464
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,350
うん
Okay.

465
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,220
山田ー！
Yamada!

466
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,420
加瀬さん！
Kase-san!

467
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,430
さっき廊下で会えたね
I saw you in the hallway just now!

468
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,220
用事済んだ？
Are you free now?

469
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,380
あぁ…
Yeah.

470
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,690
ニッキョウ大　受けるだけ受けてみることにした
I decided to try applying for Tokyo University.

471
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,350
そうなんだ
Is that so?

472
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,590
まぁ　推薦あったって試験で落ちるかもしれないけどさ
Well, even with a recommendation,
I could still fail the exams.

473
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,190
そんなことないよ　加瀬さんなら
I'm sure you'll be fine, Kase-san!

474
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,660
そうかな？
You think so?

475
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,000
そうだよ！
I know so!

476
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,000
山田の三者面談は？
How'd your parent-teacher meeting go?

477
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,340
うん
Good.

478
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,460
どこにしたの？　大学
Where did you pick? For university.

479
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,000
やっぱり地元にしたよ
Just the local one.

480
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,600
清玉女子大
Seigyoku Women's College.

481
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,140
家からも通えるしって　親が
My folks said I can commute there from home, too.

482
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,470
そ…そっか
I... see.

483
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,130
私も　いきなり県外に出るの無理かなって　だから
I don't think I could up and leave the prefecture, so...

484
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,630
いいね！　いいと思う　清玉！
Sounds great! I think Seigyoku is a fine choice.

485
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,540
山田に合ってると思うよ　うん
I think it suits you well. Yeah.

486
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,000
緑も多いし　あの辺
There's lots of greenery 'round there.

487
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,740
うん！
Yup!

488
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,800
で…
Well...

489
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,220
この雨ん中でも　緑化委員は休まないんだ
Not even this rain stops the gardener, huh?

490
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,420
晴れの日も雨の日も　ガーデニングに休みはないのです！
It takes sunny days and rainy days,
but gardening takes no holidays!

491
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,120
よし！　手伝うよ！
Lemme lend a hand!

492
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,460
あっ　傘！
The umbrella—

493
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,380
平気！
I'm fine!

494
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,230
あそこの
Those ones!

495
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,310
アジサイ？
The hydrangeas?

496
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,000
うん！
Yeah!

497
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,980
ど…どこに置こっか？
Where should I put these?

498
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,680
あっちの赤い鉢の隣
By the red pot there.

499
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,640
よっし
Gotcha.

500
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,690
せーの
And pull...

501
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,690
せーの
Pull!

502
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,610
いいよなー花は　私も山田に育ててほしい
Flowers sure have it nice.
I wanna be raised by Yamada, too.

503
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,150
な…なにそれ
What the heck?

504
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:41,790
山田にね　雑草や悪い虫から守ってもらったり　水かけてもらったりして
Yamada would give me water
and protect me from weeds and bugs.

505
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,880
元気にすくすく育ちたい
I wanna grow up fast and healthy like that!

506
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,130
加瀬さん　何言ってっ
Kase-san! What are you...

507
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,750
いいでしょ　花になりたいなー　私
It sounds nice. I wanna be a flower too.

508
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,420
雨！　濡れちゃうよ！
The rain! You'll get wet!

509
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,650
花
A flower.

510
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,390
私は
I think

511
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,400
加瀬さんには　花がよく似合うと思います
flowers really suit Kase-san.

512
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,030
一番似合う花は　ヒマワリ
And the one that suits her the most is a sunflower.

513
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,310
夏の太陽に向かって 真っ直ぐ伸びる花
A flower that springs up toward the summer sun.

514
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,650
ねぇ　山田
Hey, Yamada.

515
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,910
どうして文学部なの？
Why'd you go with the faculty of arts?

516
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,880
えっと…
Well...

517
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,200
あっ　ちょっとごめん
I gotta take this.

518
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,840
はい　もしもし
Hello?

519
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,810
はい　やっぱりそっち行ってみることにしました
Yeah, I decided to go with that one.

520
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,320
えっ　はい
Um, yeah.

521
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,090
本当ですか？
Are you serious?!

522
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,270
いま友達と一緒で
I'm with a friend right now.

523
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,220
また夜にでも？
Maybe later tonight?

524
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,230
明日またね
See you tomorrow!

525
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,340
うん
Right!

526
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,180
また
See you!

527
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,000
どうして文学部なの？
Why'd you go with the faculty of arts?

528
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,000
へー山田　清玉女子に決めたの？
Ooh, so you decided to go to Seigyoku?

529
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,150
やっぱ地元なんだ
Does that mean you're staying?

530
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,920
そういう
Guess so.

531
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,640
三河っちは？
You, Mikawacchi?

532
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,310
私は…
I'll attend...

533
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,340
受かったところに行こうかなって
wherever I pass my entrance exams!

534
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,190
すごい　適当なんだ
That's super carefree!

535
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,570
私には私の人生ってもんがあるからね
That's just how I live my life.

536
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,000
山田いいの？　本当に
Are you okay with it, Yamada? Be honest.

537
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,380
Name: Zephyranthes
Found on an embankment where I sang with Yamada
Perennial plant in the Amaryllis family
Blooms with white, yellow and pink flowers
Also known as a rain lily because it blooms after rainstorms

538
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,380

539
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,380

540
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,380
Name: Zephyranthes
Found on an embankment where I sang with Yamada
Perennial plant in the Amaryllis family
Blooms with white, yellow and pink flowers
Also known as a rain lily because it blooms after rainstorms

541
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,000
何が？
With what?

542
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,430
加瀬さんだよ
Kase-san, obviously!

543
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,620
スポーツ推薦で東京の大学に行くかもって　知ってるよね
You do realize she might go to university
in Tokyo with her sports recommendation?

544
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,280
受験するって言うだけで決まったわけじゃ
She just said she was taking exams,
so it's not set in ston—

545
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,240
決まったようなもんじゃん！
It is set in stone!

546
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,640
違うよ！
No!

547
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,000
３年は夏で部活引退なのに
All seniors leave their clubs in summer.

548
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,160
加瀬さんは特別に現役で続行でしょ　現実見なよ山田
Yet Kase-san's been given an exemption to stay and keep training.
Face up to reality, Yamada.

549
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,020
あー！　聞こえない　聞こえません！
La la la la la! I can't hear you! I'm not listening!

550
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,360
加瀬さんが東京行ったらどうすんの？
What'll you do if Kase-san goes to Tokyo?

551
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,240
どうって　まだわからないし
I don't know quite yet.

552
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,760
やれやれ
Man oh man!

553
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,680
でもまぁ　考えてみればそんなもんか
Well, think about it. That's the way it works.

554
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,860
うちらだってさ　友だちになったの高１からで
Take us, for example.
We only became friends in freshman year.

555
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,810
３年前はまだ会ったこともなかったっしょ
Three years ago, we hadn't even met each other.

556
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,990
そっか
You're right.

557
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,450
そういうの小学生からずっと何回もやってきたよね
It's been happening ever since grade school.
This isn't the first time.

558
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,550
うん
Yeah...

559
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:05,170
進学したら新しい出会いが待ってる　加瀬さんだって
Graduation means new people and new experiences.
That goes for Kase-san, too.

560
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,330
あっ　ほら！
See for yourself!

561
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,800
やだもう　加瀬ってば
Jeez, Kase...

562
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,930
そんなこと嬉しそうじゃん
Wouldn't it make you happy?

563
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,210
か…加瀬さん？
K-Kase-san?

564
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,130
加瀬さん！
Kase-san!

565
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,540
加瀬さん　行かないで！
Kase-san! Don't go!

566
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,180
行ってきます
See you later.

567
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,790
ちょっと結衣　かばん　かばん
You forgot your bag, Yui!

568
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,750
しっかりしなさい　もう
Pull yourself together, okay?

569
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,540
加瀬　おはよう
Morning, Kase!

570
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,300
今日も朝練？　大変だね
Morning practice again? You've got it rough.

571
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,580
おはよう！
Mornin'!

572
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,620
あっ　おはよう山田
Oh! Good morning, Yamada!

573
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,100
お…おはよう
G-Good morning!

574
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,880
私
Just what

575
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,870
何してるんだろう
am I doing?

576
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,340
卒業したら　会えなくなるかも
After graduation, we may never meet again.

577
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,520
それまでの間
But for the time being...

578
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,570
もっともっと
There's still so much

579
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,740
一緒に話して
we have to talk about!

580
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,850
ずっとずっと
I wanted us

581
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
一緒にいたいのに
to be together forever.

582
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,000
はい
Hey.

583
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,310
どうしたの　山田
Talk to me, Yamada.

584
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
私なにかした？
Did I do something wrong?

585
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,380
別に何も
No, you didn't.

586
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,000
私が東京行くから？
Is it because I'm going to Tokyo?

587
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,500
そんなこと
That's not it!

588
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,860
そんなことないよ
That's not it at all.

589
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,550
だよね
You're right.

590
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,010
まだ大学受かるって決まったわけでもないし
It's not like I already passed my exams.

591
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,090
う…受かるよ！　加瀬さんなら絶対
You'll pass! I'm sure you will!

592
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,490
ねぇ　山田
Um, Yamada...

593
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,140
私　山田と離れたくないよ
I don't want to leave you.

594
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,630
この前で辛くなって
I felt so terrible a while ago

595
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,570
コーチに　推薦やめて地元の大学受けるって言ったの
I told the coach I'd give up my recommendation
and go to a local college.

596
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,390
地元の？
Local...?

597
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,220
そしたら職員会議になったらしくって　校長室呼ばれた
They made a staff meeting out of it,
and I was called to the principal's office.

598
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,450
そんなことが…
I never knew...

599
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,960
私は山田と一緒にいたい　本当だよ
I want to be with you, Yamada. Believe me.

600
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,580
私　加瀬さんが東京行っても　毎日電話するし　休みには会いに行くよ
Even if you go to Tokyo, I'll call you
every day, and visit on holidays!

601
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,340
だから…
So...

602
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,500
推薦　頑張って
take the recommendation!

603
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,470
ありがとう山田
Thank you, Yamada.

604
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,000
加瀬さんの出発の日
The day Kase-san left.

605
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,740
加瀬さん！
Kase-san!

606
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,600
明日試験だよね
The exam's tomorrow, right?

607
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,930
うん　明日
Yup, tomorrow!

608
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,270
これから夕方の新幹線で行くよ
I'm taking the evening Shinkansen.

609
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,300
東京　頑張ってね！
Good luck out in Tokyo!

610
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,330
うん
Thanks.

611
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,310
中庭　ちょっと広くなった？
The yard looks more spacious than usual.

612
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,640
あぁ　わかる？
You noticed?

613
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,300
わかるよ　いつも見てるもん
Of course I did! I see it every day.

614
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,620
すごい　そんなこと言うの　加瀬さんだけだよ
That's something only you would notice!

615
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,390
もうすぐ文化祭だから　吹奏楽と管弦が使うでしょ
The cultural festival's around the corner,
and our concert band will likely use the courtyard.

616
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,000
少し空間を広げないとって思って切ったんだ
I figured I had to make some space so I cut a few things.

617
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
なんか　もったいないね
Kinda feels like a waste.

618
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,200
ううん　中庭はみんなのものだし
Not at all. The schoolyard belongs to everyone.

619
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:19,350
山田…　いつも私をすごいって言うけど
Yamada... You're always saying I'm amazing and whatnot,

620
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,810
私からすれば山田のほうがすごいと思う
but the way I see it, you're the amazing one here.

621
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,010
すごいよ！
You're amazing!

622
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,790
ごめん
One sec.

623
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,860
もしもし？
Hello?

624
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,940
あっはい　今から行きます
That's right. I'm on my way now.

625
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,600
卒業したら
After graduation,

626
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,240
東京着？　えっと…
In Tokyo? Uh...

627
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,830
そこでまた　新しい出会いが待ってる
new people and new experiences await.

628
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,170
結構遅い時間
some ungodly hour.

629
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,300
大学生になっても私達は
But even in university, we'll still...

630
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,620
ですよね
I know, right?

631
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,270
じゃあ　夜に
See you tonight.

632
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,740
今の人　あっちにいる友達　東京駅に迎えに来てくれるって
That was a good friend of mine.
She's coming to meet me at Tokyo Station.

633
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,320
すっごくいい人なの
She's super nice!

634
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,160
あっ　そっか　心強いね
I see! That's reassuring.

635
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,390
その日はとても
That evening had

636
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,020
じゃあ山田　頑張ってくるね
Alright, Yamada. Good luck with everything!

637
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,060
頑張って
Good luck!

638
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,440
とても　綺麗な夕焼けでした
the most gorgeous red sunset.

639
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,590
加瀬さんのいない学校は
With Kase-san gone,

640
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,320
とても静かで
the schoolground took on a quiet air.

641
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,550
がらんとしてる
As if it were empty.

642
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,550
違うよ！　がらんとしてるのは
No! What's really empty...

643
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,960
私！
...is my heart!

644
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,620
加瀬さんがいないなんて
Life without Kase-san...

645
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,390
加瀬さんと離れちゃうなんて
If Kase-san's gone, I'll...

646
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,230
新大阪・東京方面　間もなく発車いたします
The train bound for Shin-Osaka and Tokyo will depart shortly

647
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,490
じゃあね　加瀬
This is it, Kase.

648
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,840
頑張ってみて
Give 'em your best.

649
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,450
はいコーチ！
Will do, Coach!

650
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,250
降りる駅は終点だからね
Don't get off until the last stop.

651
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,180
コーチ　小学生じゃないんですから
Hey, I'm not an elementary schooler!

652
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,320
私も！
I'm coming, too!

653
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,200
山田！
Yamada!

654
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,980
東京の大学に！
I'll go to a Tokyo university!

655
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,010
加瀬さんと一緒に！
To be with you!

656
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,290
山田ー！
Yamada!

657
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,880
行くよ！
Let's go!

658
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,170
加瀬さんがいないと仕方ないよ
I can't imagine life without you, Kase-san!

659
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,720
加瀬さんと一緒じゃなくちゃ
Because I want to be with you...

660
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,460
山田…
Yamada!

661
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,000
私…
...forever!

662
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,480
嬉しい
Thank you.

663
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:15,000
光る汗、Tシャツ、出会った恋
It all began with a t-shirt drenched in glittering sweat

664
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,000
誰よりも輝く君を見て
You were shining brighter than anyone else

665
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,000
初めての気持ちを見つけたよ
I felt it was love at first sight

666
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:32,000
新たな旅が始まる
and my mind set off on a new journey

667
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,720
雨上がり、気まぐれ、蒼い風
I ran like a summer wind after the rain

668
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:42,880
強い日差し　いつか追い越して
as if to overtake the blinding sun

669
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:48,210
これから描いて行く恋の色
Hoping to paint my world with the colors of love

670
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:53,450
始まりのページ彩るよ
I splashed its tones across a brand new page

671
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:59,010
占い雑誌　ふたつの星に
Checking magazine horoscopes to see if stars align

672
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:04,360
二人の未来を重ねてみるの
Hoping our signs will point to a future

673
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,840
かさぶただらけ　とれない心
This bruised heart couldn't take another beating

674
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:15,200
あなたの優しさでふさがる
until your kindness came to mend it back to full

675
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:23,300
いつの間にか　すきま空いた 心が満たされて行く
And before I knew it,
the wounds my heart showed began to fade

676
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,420
ふとした瞬間の　さりげない仕草
the moment it bore witness
to your carefree everyday self

677
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:34,080
いつの日にか　夢を語る　あなたの顔をずっと
One of these days, when we talk about
our dreams, your face will light up

678
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,480
見つめていたい　微笑んでいたい
then we'll lock eyes and smile at one another

679
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:55,000
大切な何かを守るとき
When you want to protect
what's most important to you

680
00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:01,150
踏み出せる一歩が勇気なら
take the first step forward
and have faith in yourself

681
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:06,700
傷つくことから逃げ出して
If you trip up, don't run away

682
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,760
いつもただ遠回りばかり
because it's only a minor setback

683
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,140
行き場なくした強がりのクセが
My bluff is called and stops in its tracks

684
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,610
心の中で戸惑っているよ
leaving my heart full of questions

685
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,990
初めて知ったあなたの想いに
Having finally learned how you feel

686
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:33,080
言葉より涙あふれてくる
I'm left speechless, tears springing to my eyes

687
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,820
少し幅の違う足で　一歩ずつ歩こうね
Our paces may differ,
but we'll walk this path together

688
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:43,880
二人で歩む道　でこぼこの道
A winding road for us to tackle together

689
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,710
二つ折りの白い地図に　記す小さな決意を
On this white map, folded in two,
I jot down a short answer

690
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:55,010
正直に今　伝えよう
so that I may open up to you

691
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,220
耳元で聞こえる二人のメロディー
With our harmony ringing out into my ears

692
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:16,480
溢れ出す涙こらえて
I choke up, struggling to hold in my tears

693
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,900
ありきたりの言葉　あなたに言うよ
I say to you, ordinary as it may seem,

694
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:27,140
「これからもずっと一緒だよね…」
"I'll always be right by your side!"

695
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,140
「これからもずっと一緒だよね…」
"I'll always be right by your side!"

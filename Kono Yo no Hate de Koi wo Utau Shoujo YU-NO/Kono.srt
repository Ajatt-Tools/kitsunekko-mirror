1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,290
What is that?

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,460
A mermaid!

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,920
Now it's done!

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,640
It got washed away, huh?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,510
I'll make another one.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,890
Okay, let's make it together, then!

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,220
Yeah!

8
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:08,200
"Episode 15: A Summer That Won't Come Back"

9
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,830
Ten more minutes...

10
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,160
Takuya-kun, wake up!

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Your friends are here!

12
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,170
Want to come inside and wait?

13
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,090
No, we'll wait here.

14
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,970
Sorry, I'll get ready right away!

15
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,390
Boss, hurry up!

16
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,520
Hurry up, or we'll be late for the train!

17
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,060
They're so loud again today...

18
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,070
Did you remember to bring suntan lotion?

19
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,690
Oh, and make sure you take insect spray.

20
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,780
Thank you, Ayumi-san.

21
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,360
Oh, right.

22
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,370
Where'd you put the fever reducer?

23
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,700
The second drawer in the cupboard.

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,160
Do you have a fever?

25
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,580
Just in case.

26
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,500
Oh, you should probably
take some candles just in case.

27
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,590
Yeah. I should probably
take a rope and a whip, too.

28
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,380
I can find them in your room, right?

29
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,470
Of course not!

30
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,140
Bye!

31
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,220
Oh wait, Takuya-kun.

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,470
Here.

33
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,810
This belonged to Kodai-san.
It looks good on you.

34
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,810
Okay, see you later.

35
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,650
Have a good time!

36
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,980
Okay!

37
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,860
Three of them, huh?

38
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,570
I can't wait!

39
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,620
Hojo...

40
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,590
Sorry to keep you waiting.

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Hatano-san, you look so cute!

42
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
It's so weird to see you out of your uniform.

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,940
Let's go. We'll be late for the train.

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,940
"Erufu-Mochi"

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,950
Shimazu-san, try this!

46
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,320
It's addicting!

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,120
Oh, you can have some too
if you want, Hatano-san.

48
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,120
Did we have to bring all this stuff, though?

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,960
It's all stuff we need for
a summer trip to the beach.

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,130
We couldn't have blown up
the swim ring when we got there?

51
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,380
And we could've bought
a watermelon there, too.

52
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,390
If they only have pre-cut ones,
we won't be able to do watermelon-splitting!

53
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,430
Is it that important?

54
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,180
Shimazu-san says she's never done it!

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,230
Seriously? That's just
what you do in summer!

56
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,350
Dad said I couldn't...

57
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,230
I see. A dignified young girl
like you can't be allowed

58
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,150
anywhere near something that barbaric, huh?

59
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,950
It's Shimazu-san's first classic summer experience!

60
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,030
I'll be with her every step of the way, too!

61
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,280
It's your first time too, right Kanna-chan?

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,450
I'll be with you every step of the way...

63
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,170
I split watermelons once before.

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,580
You did, huh?

65
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,130
It's hard to imagine you
swinging around a stick...

66
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,340
I think I'm better at it than most.

67
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,390
When's our transfer...

68
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,140
We'll have to wait a while.

69
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,100
Yeah.

70
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,310
Let's have some snacks, then!

71
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,230
Already?

72
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,770
He followed us all the way out here?

73
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,860
Is there something special about that guy?

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,950
He's following Kanna-chan around.

75
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,570
Is he one of those "stalker" guys?

76
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,580
Are we supposed to call
the cops at a time like this?

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,700
Or let the station staff know?

78
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,750
Wait. I've got an idea.

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,510
Nice package you've got there.

80
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,140
What's important is how hard it gets.

81
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,230
You don't want to know
where Kodai Arima is?

82
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,850
You know?

83
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,020
Not me. Kanna knows.

84
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,480
Try stealing her pendant, and then saying,

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,950
"If you want it back,
tell me where Kodai Arima is."

86
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,950
That's a stupid idea. Bye.

87
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,160
H-Hey! Wait!

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Argh, I can't stop!

89
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,130
Where'd you go?

90
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,560
A-A watermelon?

91
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,320
You tricked me!

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,110
That train runs nonstop to the end of the line.

93
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,780
Never come back.

94
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,660
My watermelon...

95
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,240
My "Masakatsu Presents" watermelon...

96
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,330
Don't get so down.

97
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,580
We can buy one when we get there.

98
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,590
Kanna-chan, you can use this straw hat instead.

99
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,380
Thank you.

100
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,130
It's huge!

101
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,340
Just in case, I have to ask.

102
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,260
There's no shotgun-wielding
mayors inside, right?

103
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,520
Arima-kun, how did
you know my dad had a gun?

104
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Um, I just kind of had a
feeling he'd be the kind of dad

105
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,530
who'd hunt any beast-like men
who got near his daughter.

106
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,820
Don't worry. My dad's busy
with the city council right now.

107
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,160
Now come inside.

108
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,700
Excuse us!

109
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,160
Excuse me.

110
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,660
I'm going upstairs to change.

111
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,040
You boys find some place
to change on your own.

112
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,800
Roger!

113
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,130
Let's go change, Boss!

114
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,880
Yeah.

115
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,840
Pervert!

116
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,800
Why are you the one screaming?

117
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,770
Don't worry about me, please.

118
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,680
Aww, it's not that easy...

119
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,400
I'll go upstairs too, then.

120
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,200
Hatano-san is a little weird, huh?

121
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,490
Hojo's out there somewhere, too.

122
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,660
Just in case...

123
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,550
A private beach!

124
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,090
This is amazing!

125
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,880
There's no need to be in such a hurry.

126
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,760
The ocean's not going anywhere.

127
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,850
Shimazu-san's bikini...

128
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,480
Cute!

129
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,650
Sorry to keep you waiting.

130
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,030
What were you expecting?

131
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,790
Okay, let's go have some fun!

132
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,500
Yeah!

133
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,520
What are you making?

134
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,810
A mermaid!

135
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,730
Now it's done!

136
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,990
My mermaid!

137
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,450
It got washed away, huh?

138
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,580
Kanna-chan, do you have
an older sister or something?

139
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,790
No. I've always been alone.

140
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,290
Alone? What about your family?

141
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,590
I don't have any.

142
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,090
I used to live with my mother, but...

143
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,340
I see!

144
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,300
Boss!

145
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,720
It's no good! They don't sell watermelons!

146
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,270
It's watermelon season, too...

147
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,190
They didn't have a whole one.

148
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,190
And I was looking forward to Shimazu-san's
first watermelon-splitting experience.

149
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,320
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

150
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,580
Mistress...

151
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,000
Shall I lather your body with lotion?

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
No thanks.

153
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,960
There's no telling what
you'd try and take a peek at.

154
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,300
I'll lather you however you like.

155
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,720
Stop doing that with your hands.

156
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,100
I'm amazed your dad let us do this, though.

157
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,140
The four of us getting
a whole villa to ourselves...

158
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,810
If he finds out, he'll bring that gun.

159
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,810
If he finds out? Don't tell me...

160
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,150
I said I was staying with my girlfriends.

161
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,940
Did you really have to go that far?

162
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,950
It's not for your sake!

163
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,950
Oh, right!

164
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,740
I have to get photos to show my dad for proof.

165
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,950
Hatano-san!

166
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,370
Huh?

167
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,290
Where'd she go?

168
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,210
You two aren't going in the water?

169
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,130
I don't see Kanna-chan.

170
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,420
Kanna-chan!

171
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,550
Hatano-san!

172
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,680
Where'd she go, I wonder?

173
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,930
Let's split up and look.

174
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey!

175
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,400
Are you in here?

176
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,810
Hatano-san?

177
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,110
Kanna-chan! Where did you--

178
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,610
Is something wrong?

179
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,530
A watermelon?

180
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,160
Where'd you get that?

181
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,290
There's a watermelon field down the road.

182
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,790
The farmer gave me one.

183
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,250
Hatano-san!

184
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,670
Okay!

185
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,550
Let's get started!

186
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,800
It's Shimazu-san's first time!

187
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,010
Here I go!

188
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,970
I'm starting so far away?

189
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,890
And with a blindfold, too!

190
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,890
Hey!

191
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,230
And then you spin, too!

192
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,480
Now go ahead!

193
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,900
I don't know which way to go!

194
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,820
--Left! Go left! Left!
--Right! Your right! Right! No!

195
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,910
Which way is it?

196
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:27,590
--Right! Right! Right! Go right!
--Left! Left! Go straight ahead! Straight ahead!

197
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,010
What you guys said is totally wrong!

198
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,430
That's just how it goes on your first time!

199
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,480
You do it next, Arima-kun!

200
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,730
I used to be on the kendo team, you know!

201
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,940
Don't blame me if the
watermelon ends up pulverized.

202
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,650
Okay, you can go last.

203
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,690
Hatano-san, you can go next!

204
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,070
All right, I will.

205
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll put on my blindfold.

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now I'll spin.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,250
Here I go.

208
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,630
--Right! Right! Right!
--Left! To your left!

209
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,880
Huh?

210
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,190
That was delicious.

211
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,360
Yeah.

212
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,660
Um... Hatano-san?

213
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,410
Thank you for getting that watermelon.

214
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,540
It was nothing.

215
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Wait, Yuki!

216
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,080
Just try and catch me!

217
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,380
Hey, do you want to go in the water too?

218
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,380
But...

219
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,420
Even if you can't swim, you can go in a little.

220
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,260
It feels good.

221
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,090
I didn't bring a bathing suit.

222
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,100
I have an old one I keep here.

223
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,560
You can wear it.

224
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,850
She disappeared again.

225
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,400
Is something wrong?

226
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,910
That's perfect!

227
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,410
You might lose that pendant
if you take it in the water.

228
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,870
Why not leave it here?

229
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,170
Okay.

230
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,880
It's cold...

231
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,350
Don't force yourself to do
anything you don't want to.

232
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,560
But it feels good.

233
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,120
Let's all light fireworks after dinner!

234
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,170
First, we need to eat.

235
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,880
What's wrong?

236
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,130
My pendant...

237
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,590
I left it here!

238
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,760
Without it, I...

239
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,600
Huh? The meat for the BBQ is gone!

240
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,560
The frankfurters, too!

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,230
What's going on?

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
What was that sound?

243
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,200
Think the mayor came after us with shotgun?

244
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,950
If that was my dad,
you and Yuki-kun would be dead by now.

245
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,500
Yeah.

246
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,840
Huh?

247
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,800
What is this?

248
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,680
The Reflector Device is gone.

249
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,640
Was it Hojo?

250
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,890
What's down there?

251
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,140
A basement.

252
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,900
Yuki, come with me.

253
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,600
Right!

254
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,230
Mio, you watch Kanna-chan!

255
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,610
Right.

256
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,780
Don't worry about a thing.

257
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,450
We're all here for you.

258
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,390
So, he did it?

259
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,400
He went that way!

260
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,780
Are you okay?

261
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,610
I'm fine.

262
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,900
What dog is this?

263
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,360
A wild dog. Get back.

264
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,580
Watch out!

265
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,720
I was looking forward to that barbeque...

266
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,640
We lost all our fireworks, too.

267
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,730
So there's nothing for dinner?

268
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,730
I've got some instant ramen.

269
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,780
Our summer...

270
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,910
Nah. I won't.

271
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,160
What are you talking about?

272
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,500
You only get one shot at youth, you know.

273
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,000
This summer will never come again.

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,090
We only get one shot at it. That's why it's fun.

275
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,640
You got a tan, huh?

276
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,770
Yeah. The water stung a little.

277
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,350
You should put some lotion on it.

278
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,190
Sit down. I'll do it for you.

279
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,580
A lot happened, but it was fun, huh?

280
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,660
It wasn't fun for you?

281
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:43,420
It's my first time having fun
with friends like this.

282
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,590
It was... fun.

283
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,840
Let's all come back here next summer.

284
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,140
Yuki, don't push me!

285
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,190
Stop pushing me!

286
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,740
Oh no. More wild dogs?

287
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,590
Hey, what do you think
about Arima-kun, Hatano-san?

288
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,920
When he's around, my heart beats faster.

289
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,550
I see.

290
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,640
The same thing happens
to me when I'm with him.

291
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,310
We're the same, huh?

292
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,890
Yes.

293
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:07,500
Oh? There's the frankfurter
I thought I'd lost...

294
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,760
Time to eat!

Shimazu-san and I are going this way.

298
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,720
See you around, Arima-kun!

299
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,850
You too, Kanna-chan.

300
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,430
Okay, see you later.

Bye!

302
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,820
It was a lot of fun.

303
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Thanks for inviting me.

304
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,990
Aww, it was nothing.

305
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,620
Anyway, want me to walk you home?

306
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,170
No, I'll be fine on my own.

307
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,670
Bye.

308
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,170

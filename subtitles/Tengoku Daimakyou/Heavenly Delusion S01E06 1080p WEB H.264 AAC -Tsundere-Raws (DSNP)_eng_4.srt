00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,762
Water--

4
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,098
Oh, this place.

5
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,768
If you go a little past
that elevated track,

6
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,687
there's an underground entrance.

7
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,605
Water gets collected over there.

8
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,649
Thanks for the help.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,111
Hey, do you need a place to sleep?

10
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,195
HOTEL
CLEAN FUTONS

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,573
I have clean rooms
and aired-out futons, you know.

12
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,910
Sorry, but we're just passing through.

13
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,789
I see.

14
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,667
Well,

15
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,672
it'd be good to leave our bags
while we get water.

16
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,716
Since the water will be heavy.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,722
You did that just to give her money.

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,017
You're too nice.
What if she steals everything?

19
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,811
We don't have anything worth stealing.

20
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,357
She even told us to take our money
and valuables with us.

21
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,775
<i>Let's trust her.</i>

22
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,860
100% SAFE WATER

23
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,237
Look.

24
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,282
Isn't this it? The underground entrance.

25
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,958
BICYCLE PARKING - OPEN 24 HOURS

26
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,635
It's water.

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,097
But isn't it just collecting here?

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,016
It doesn't look very clean.

29
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,396
SUBWAY

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,023
Someone's collapsed over there!

31
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,817
Maru! Don't jump
recklessly into the water!

32
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,126
That looks really bad.

33
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,670
Is he still alive?

34
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,754
My buddy…

35
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,048
Help my buddy.

36
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,678
It was a monster.

37
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,180
My buddy…

38
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,765
Help…

39
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,705
-That guy's a goner.
-Sis.

40
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,548
Run!

41
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,968
It worked.

42
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,639
It took an extra shot, but…

43
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,351
Look. It's out cold.

44
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,022
Once you know it's gonna chase you,
it's easy to come up with a plan.

45
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,067
Your quick thinking is really amazing.

46
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,571
Hurry up and kill it, Maru.

47
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,864
Oh, right.

48
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,200
All right.

49
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,578
Fatal Dive!

50
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,708
<i>Fatal Dive! Fatal Dive!</i>
<i>Fatal Dive! Fatal Dive!</i>

51
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,177
Why…

52
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,764
It's not a Hiruko! It's a wild animal!

53
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,975
What? No way!

54
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,060
Over there, Maru!

55
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,978
Sis, wait!

56
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,313
Here. Hurry up!

57
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,564
W-wait!

58
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,941
Climb up!

59
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,537
Good thing I managed to get up here.

60
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,710
It's a bear! A bear!

61
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,712
Can you imagine how that felt, Sis?

62
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,131
Just when I was thinking,

63
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,717
"Huh? It's not going in. That's weird."

64
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,720
I met the bear's eyes from this distance!

65
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,555
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

66
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,932
That guy said it was a monster!

67
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,226
Don't blame it on someone else!

68
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,729
That bear basically is a monster!

69
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:42,027
But it's a good thing it's a bear.
It can't climb up.

70
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,653
We'd be done for if it was a gorilla.

71
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,079
Not good.

72
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,290
It's getting cold.

73
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,710
Wait. Where did the bear go?

74
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,589
It kept walking around, but it's gone now.

75
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,424
Let's take the chance to get away.

76
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,431
If the fourth bullet fires,
I've got one shot left.

77
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,058
Will it shoot?

78
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,436
I'll warm up the battery.

79
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,816
Uh-oh.

80
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,610
What? "Uh-oh"?

81
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,946
Three choices.

82
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,033
One. I dropped the battery.

83
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,535
Two. Well--

84
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,330
That is--

85
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,165
What are you doing?

86
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,044
Geez, it really fell.

87
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,421
-Go get it.
-Stop joking.

88
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,757
What if the bear is still around?

89
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,677
Maru.

90
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,181
Do you see me as a woman? Or a man?

91
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,934
What? What's with that question?

92
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,481
Well, you look like a woman, so--

93
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,110
I guess that's probably
not what you want to hear, but…

94
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,194
Okay!

95
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,614
I'll let you touch my boobs
if you get it--

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,826
He jumped!

97
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,828
That idiot!

98
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,376
Maru!

99
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,003
There it is!

100
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,930
It was hiding and waiting
for us to come down.

101
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,890
It's definitely targeting us.

102
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,476
We can wait it out forever up here

103
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,396
or get down and shoot it
when it's in range.

104
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,772
Damn it.

105
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,191
Maru,

106
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,487
I managed to climb up
from the adrenaline rush,

107
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,032
but I can't climb down from here.

108
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,868
-What?
-No, see.

109
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,370
It's not normal to be as tough as you.

110
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,414
Normal people can't handle this height!

111
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,416
So Maru,

112
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,587
this time, go down with the Kiru-Beam
and kill the bear.

113
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,549
Then I'll use the dead bear as a cushion
and get down.

114
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,638
As long as it's not a Man-eater,
all you need is one shot to the head.

115
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,309
Let me tell you one thing, Sis.

116
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,230
Even if you give me the gun,
I can't shoot as accurately as you.

117
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,233
Am I that good of a shot?

118
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,027
Yeah, you're really good.

119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,738
Normally, you can't shoot a power pole
while climbing a fence

120
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,783
or aim for the enemy's arm while running.

121
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,577
Am I helpful?

122
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,870
Of course you are.

123
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,081
I would've died five times already
without you.

124
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,169
Sis?

125
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,715
I'm help--

126
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,884
<i>I want to be helpful to Robin.</i>

127
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,638
<i>I'm not playing around!</i>
<i>I told you not to come. It's dangerous!</i>

128
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,889
<i>I'll drive it away.</i>

129
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,140
<i>I know I can do it.</i>

130
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,477
Okay!

131
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,854
Let's make a new plan.

132
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,570
<i>First, wait for the bear to get far away</i>
<i>while warming up our bodies.</i>

133
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,155
<i>And once it's far away?</i>

134
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,033
<i>Maru, you use that chance to get down.</i>

135
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>I'll come down as soon as I hear you land.</i>

136
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,760
<i>Then you run as fast as you can</i>
<i>after catching me.</i>

137
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,806
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>What if the fourth shot doesn't fire?</i>

138
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,561
<i>If that happens…</i>

139
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,941
<i>I'll hold it off until you get away.</i>

140
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,137
Why didn't you get away?

141
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,309
You actually thought
I'd run away alone? That hurts.

142
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,478
And it was a flaw in your plan.

143
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,401
I was confident
the fourth shot would fire.

144
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,569
What?

145
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,573
The battery was charged
with your horny energy!

146
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,825
What the hell? Stop that!

147
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,162
Hey!

148
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,542
Iwata! Hang in there! Iwata!

149
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,505
-Boss.
-Shimomoto didn't make it.

150
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,589
Totori.

151
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,509
What about the people who saved Iwata?

152
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:02,180
They said their names weren't worth it
and left like the wind.

153
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,556
For real?

154
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,810
Who were they? The bear's head
was completely blown away.

155
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,436
HOTEL

156
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,481
-I wanted to meet them.
-Yeah.

157
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,067
To think there'd be a bear around here--

158
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,944
It's so nice animals aren't like Hiruko.

159
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,905
Their carcasses don't disappear
and we can eat them.

160
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,368
I'll tell you how we got tricked,
so you can keep it in mind.

161
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,661
We got tricked?

162
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,290
The vigilantes in the tent city
were also bandits.

163
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,670
We were completely lured
into their hunting grounds.

164
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,381
Lured?

165
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,758
100% safe water.

166
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,137
<i>I'm sure their plan was to block</i>

167
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,848
<i>the underground entrance</i>
<i>once we got close.</i>

168
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,643
That map-seller must've been in on it too.

169
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,355
Then we can't trust anything on the map.

170
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,191
It might not all be fake.

171
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,611
That's enough regretting. Let's sleep.

172
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,406
We're stuck here anyway.

173
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,992
What's wrong?

174
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:08,246
She gave us two rooms, so let's sleep
comfortably on our own.

175
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,708
Did you forget something?

176
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:17,672
Did you forget about your promise, Sis?

177
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,053
I risked my life, you know.

178
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,098
Let me touch your boobs.

179
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,435
{\an8}HOTEL

180
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,189
{\an8}My sister's hair was originally
black and straight.

181
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,068
It seems your hair can change

182
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,195
after undergoing surgery
for a major injury.

183
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:46,785
That's probably why I started growing
this red, dry hair.

184
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,788
But I think it's a curse from my sister.

185
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,417
Saying "Don't mess with my body!"

186
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,002
I see.

187
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,797
Now take off your jacket.

188
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:06,179
You sure?
Touching my boobs means this, you know.

189
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,516
If you still say it doesn't matter,
then I'll keep my promise.

190
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,477
Because it's a promise between men!

191
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,441
Wai-- Rules! Let's set some rules.

192
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,609
Like how many sec--

193
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,530
<i>That sounded just like a girl.</i>

194
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,616
Hey, you two.

195
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,454
PLEASE KEEP THE ROOMS CLEAN

196
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,041
{\an8}PLEASE DON'T DIRTY THE FUTON

197
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,545
This is not the place for doing that!

198
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,297
-You, come this way.
-Wait.

199
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,053
Sir,

200
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,932
how about me?

201
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,769
Eight hundred thousand.

202
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,188
Or that solar-powered light!

203
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,273
That will be enough.

204
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,900
So you did go through our stuff.

205
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,403
I didn't take anything,
so what's the problem?

206
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,321
So how about it?

207
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,532
Should I keep the bandana on?

208
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,953
Call me Totori. I don't know my last name.

209
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,788
Hey, I'm good.

210
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,915
Do you know what "no, thank you" means?

211
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,292
I prefer older girls--

212
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,184
You--

213
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,728
Sis! Get over here!

214
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,937
What're you doing?

215
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,814
Don't move.

216
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,191
Sis!

217
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,360
What's wrong, Maru?

218
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,112
-I got in!
-Ouch! It hurts!

219
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,201
What went in where?

220
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,418
What did you do?

221
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
No…

222
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,050
<i>After realizing</i>
<i>the difficulties of having to explain</i>

223
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,928
<i>the various misunderstandings</i>
<i>of this situation,</i>

224
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,432
<i>all Maru could see was</i>
<i>the dark depths of his despair.</i>

225
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,937
<i>There are no signs of an illness.</i>

226
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,191
Really? What a relief.

227
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,779
<i>You show signs of fatigue.</i>
<i>Please take a nap here.</i>

228
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,005
Who's there?

229
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,342
What?

230
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,395
Asura?

231
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,651
What are you good at, Tokio?

232
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,946
What do you mean?

233
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:16,828
It disappeared.

234
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,461
What? My leg is--

235
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,380
Doctor! Doctor!

236
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,555
A dream?

237
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,936
How are you feeling?

238
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,147
I'm fine.

239
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,070
DON'T COME IN

240
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,447
We are really sorry!

241
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,699
My heaven is right here.

242
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,744
I will take full responsibility.
Please forgive me.

243
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:02,040
Well, I don't mind
if we continue chatting like this.

244
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,250
But you look so pitiful,
so let's stop here.

245
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,213
You didn't do anything wrong.
I was the one who came on to you.

246
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,590
Thank you!

247
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,217
TOTORI'S HOTEL

248
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,346
Even if you ask me what I am,
I'm just your average orphan.

249
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:21,101
I can only remember being raised
by those vigilantes.

250
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:25,021
So you were born after the Great Disaster,
and raised as an orphan?

251
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,857
But your parents could be alive somewhere.

252
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,277
It's not like I want to look for them.
Or meet them.

253
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,115
I've realized something.

254
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,450
Anything that feels good makes money.

255
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,413
I'll earn money by getting
more clean rooms and futons.

256
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,666
I'll have sex with the customers I like,

257
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,168
and become the King of Hotels!

258
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:54,259
I don't get why I can enter a human.

259
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,637
But good thing I cleared up
that misunderstanding.

260
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:02,100
I thought the only way
I was gonna get you to believe me,

261
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,269
was by killing her with the Maru-Touch.

262
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,397
Oh, yeah?
Wasn't it the Whatchamacallit Dive?

263
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,607
Forget that ever happened!

264
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,778
I knew it was bad the second I said it.

265
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,281
I remember now. Fatal Dive.

266
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,033
I told you to forget it!

267
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,077
HOTEL

268
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,080
Well, see ya.

269
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,874
The futon was really comfortable.

270
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,377
What's up? You don't look too good.

271
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,463
What happened to all that energy
from last night?

272
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,799
They said the Boss didn't make it.

273
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,261
He died early in the morning.

274
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,764
Even though you saved him.

275
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,769
He was so tough.
I didn't think he would die.

276
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,856
He was a good boss. So kind to us.

277
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,361
Well, dying is a part of life.

278
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,574
Want to join us?

279
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,206
Okay.

280
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,797
Then be the King of Hotels.

281
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,557
Even a guy like that
was important to somebody.

282
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,938
If I was born and raised in this area,

283
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,941
I might've been one of his guys.

284
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,233
You look better today.

285
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,112
I was worried about something,
but it's all better now.

286
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,406
That's good.

287
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,334
DETECTING DETAILED POINTS

288
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,586
COMPARISON IN PROGRESS
INSPECTION COMPLETE

289
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,213
FEATURES - 92% MATCH
OBJECTS APPEAR IDENTICAL

290
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,674
I found it. This is it.

291
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,511
The footprint in this room is…

292
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,513
Tokio's.

293
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,017
But how? Without anyone noticing?

294
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,814
I saw Asura's ghost today.

295
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,108
Ghost?

296
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,318
But it might have been a dream.

297
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,739
You liked Asura, right?

298
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,407
Yeah.

299
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,955
But it's different to my love for you.

300
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,082
You know that, right?

301
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,753
Yeah.

302

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,391
I’ve seen Hell rise！Out of your eyes
Creep up at night To your demise

40
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:13,932
You’ve gotta’ fight I’ve gotta’ fight
Been thinkin’ that I need isolation All this devastation

41
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:24,432
Head needs renovation alright. If you
had to choose would you ever let me go？

42
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:32,253
Oh I can’t stop the
monster I’m losing my control

43
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:37,360
Oh oh！ Could someone
please save my life

44
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:41,505
Could someone please save my life

45
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:54,060
Cause I’ve gone
cold！ Save my life

46
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:58,234
Could someone please save my life

47
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,541
Could someone please save my life

48
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:10,367
Cause I’ve gone cold
And I’m stuck in the abyss all on my own！

1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:03,567
Nobody got you the way I do

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,047
Whatever demons u fighting through

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:10,516
When you need somebody to turn to

4
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:13,860
Nobody got you the way I do

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,456
I’d take the fall

6
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:20,904
If ever you feel like there’s no one at all

7
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:21,701
Ah yea and

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,353
I’d stay through the night

9
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:27,733
When you got monsters tryna take you alive

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,167
There ain’t no people or lines

11
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:34,589
That i wouldn’t cross if u need me to

12
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:38,270
I’m out here steppin on mines

13
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:41,492
And I think it’s finally time that you knew

14
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:45,101
Nobody got you the way I do

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,264
Whatever demons u fightin through

16
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:51,589
When you need somebody to turn to

17
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:54,063
Nobody got you the way I do

18
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:58,613
Nobody got u without no shade

19

I’ll take the good and the bad all day

20
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:05,453

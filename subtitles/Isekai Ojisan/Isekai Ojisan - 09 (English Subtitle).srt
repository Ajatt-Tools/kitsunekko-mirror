1
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:04,994
August 2018

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,143
A month of record-breaking high temperatures across all of Japan

3
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:15,770
...Hm? Huh.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,076
Eh.. Why!?

5
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:19,273
The saturn isn't reading disc..!?

6
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:19,955
Huh!?

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:25,154
This is a symptom of the CD-reading laser deteriorating over time and grtting weaker.

8
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:25,898
What!?

9
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:27,524
Wh-Why?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,031
No way! You're kidding? No way!

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,430
Uncle, Calm down.

12
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:31,787
Why? Why? Why?

13
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,377
We can probably fix it!

14
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,204
No way! No way!

15
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,051
Why! Why!

16
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,814
What? No way! Why?

17
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,060
No way!

18
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:21,604
I was surprised.

19
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,975
You were both sweating and fiddling with the machine.

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,232
I'm glad someone posted the fix on the internet, Uncle.

21
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:32,348
 Yeah, I never thought I could see a 64-bit CPU.

22
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:35,984
But, Saturn suddenly broke down.

23
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:37,991
It must be from the heat.

24
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,828
Who wants ice cream?

25
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:40,851
Me!!

26
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:42,420
Meee!!

27
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,341
Dad and Chiaki got this while
fishing.

28
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:46,767
I threw in the ice cream myself.

29
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:51,352
Can't you cool off with some ice magic?

30
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,407
Eh!

31
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:53,397
Oh..

32
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,049
-Ooooooh!!!

33
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,645
Aaaaaah!!!

34
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,912
Thank you, Suzumiya-san!!

35
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:06,453
Who?

36
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,751
I’m more worried that neither of you thought of it...

37
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:13,028
Hmm...The heat might be a part of it, but...

38
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:16,627
Maybe it’s a lingering aftereffect
of the temporary dragon form

39
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,791
but caring about
those things just petty to me.

40
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:24,217
I know. Dragons don’t have a care in the world about things like their future...

41
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:26,087
We could be dragons again!

42
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,936
Stop escaping to dragon form!

43
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,974
You should buy an air conditioner!

44
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,698
I'd Love to, but the money's not there...

45
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,964
It adds to the electric bill too.

46
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:38,690
Ooh, I know! What if

47
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:43,679
you took the videos you played
with your memory recollection spell and post them to youtube as-is?

48
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,115
Oh there's an idea...

49
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,522
Absolutely Not.

50
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:47,813
Why not?

51
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:51,645
Uncle, can you visualize what I'm thinking right now?

52
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,604
Let's see. It’s "ICURAS YUUL ELRAN,” So..

53
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:57,697
Memory spirit!

54
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:00,052
Display what he envisions.

55
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,599
The minotaur didn't even do anything, poor guy ('  ;ω;  ') 

You made a whole spectacle out of killing an animal...I'm shaking rn I'm so mad

Does this guy even have a hunting license?

P.sure that light sword length is illegal under the Firearms and Sword Control Law

Gotta wonder if he got siblings' permission before filming them 
Probably not 

This is animal abuse. Reported to Youtube.

Dude this is unedited guro, just OUT

You guys are getting bent out of shape over CG

Aaand it's over lol the guy in the suit's job lasted like 3 second lol

56
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,165
This would happen, guaranteed.

57
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,838
People would write those things..?

58
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,781
I would. I'd complain just for the hell of it.

59
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,023
You really are big into online stuff...

60
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,548
..With that established..Any other magic ideas?

61
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,576
Hmm. What spirit could I get favor from..?

62
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,785
Hey... It's Kind of late to ask, But,

63
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,916
What's the deal with these spirits anyway?

64
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:32,775
Hm?

65
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,441
You know, how they look and stuff.

66
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,150
Ah!

67
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,739
If were talking fantasy-world spirits, they've

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,738
<font color="#800080">DARK SPIRIT</font>    <font color="#009966"> LIGHT SPIRIT </font>
  <font color="#800080">KUROCHE</font>         <font color="#009966">KILIGHD</font>

69
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,797
gotta take the form of beautiful women, right?

70
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,553
No, they don't really have forms.

71
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:44,434
Eh

72
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,620
I call them spirits, but they're more like the collective

73
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:49,520
collective wills of phenomena

74
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:54,104
I just hear their voices here and there.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,667
It's

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,617
They... can talk, right?

77
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:01,783
Sure, they basically can.

78
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:05,602
It’s like... Their wills sort of drift into my mind.

79
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,065
They're doing it now!

80
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:10,683
I hear ‘em...
Heh-heh-heh... I hear

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,993
the voices of all
kinds of beings...

82
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,835
Is it safe for you to converse with them like that, uncle?

83
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,255
Hm? What do you mean?

84
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,239
You know... Mentally...

85
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,026
Oh... heh heh...

86
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:29,140
Well... You can see for yourself.

87
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,317
A cow head.

88
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,470
Let's buy a cow head.

89
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:39,382
Huh?

90
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,200
There's a wagyu-beef cattle head on amaz@n for five million yen...

91
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,478
They have those!?

92
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,474
Five million yen, Huh...?

93
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:50,805
Where did this come from?

94
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,666
Well, the ice spirit’s demanding compensation for the cooling spell.

95
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,663
You have to compensate them!?

96
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,125
Sure I do.

97
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,698
When you ask someone
to do something unusual, it’s

98
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,582
just good manners to thank
them and give them a gift.

99
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,289
So... Why a cow?

100
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,104
So we can make an altar and offer the head on it...

101
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,515
This is getting really weird. ..!?

102
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,539
What is uncle making a deal with here...!!?

103
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:19,616
They say if we don’t, they'll freeze all the open fielos on the planet for ten years...

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,088
Ten... That kind of overkill for compensation!?

105
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:25,613
What!? The price for our cooling is wiping out humanity!?

106
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:27,152
Seems like it.

107
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,617
My bad..

108
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:34,414
For now, I think I'll cook one of the fish you brought for lunch...

109
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,991
This might be the last year I can enjoy a full stomach...

110
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,307
Huh? What?

111
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:44,610
Oh wow, really?

112
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,552
Ah, no! Really... No! Yes... Yes...

113
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:48,094
I'll be going now!

114
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:54,091
They say they'll accept a fish head!

115
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:57,761
How little does the spirit care about humanity’s continued existence!?

116
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:02,104
I guess to the spirit, there's not much difference between a cow and a fish.

117
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,029
And humans really_

118
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:06,705
They probably only care if it
fits the loose definition of “a living creature.”

119
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,737
 I doubt they'd feel any
pain or agitation from wiping us out.

120
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,727
You "doubt"? How can you be so chill about this!?

121
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:17,504
Yeah! Humanity was just on the brink of extinction!

122
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,268
Maybe I'm just desensitized...

123
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,328
Pretty much every shooter game from the '90s started

124
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:27,822
out with humankind being
on the verge of extinction...

125
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,079
Maybe if you didn't play so many dark games...!!!

126
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:35,747
Did game developer have something against humankind in the 90's?

127
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,657
-Uncle!
-Huh!?

128
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:44,522
It’s an after effect from being a draco-human.

129
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:47,852
Raw meat and raw fish start looking awfully appetizing...

130
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:49,469
-I can sympathize.
-Don't sympathize.

131
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,873
Why'd you join him as a scaly beast, anyway?

132
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:58,111
Oh.. I figured Takafumi would be lonely if he was the only dragonesque  reptile.

133
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:04,056
I was really scared then, okay? I thought you might never come back.

134
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,788
Having a friend makes it a lot better.

135
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,008
Wanna be a dragon, fujimiya?

136
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,887
Ooh! It’d be even more fun...

137
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,413
No, I don't want to!!

138
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:15,927
...that said, when a
transformation lasts too long,

139
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:20,222
it's possible you can become
stuck that  way and never revert.

140
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:21,702
For example...

141
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,127
ICURAS
ELRAN.

142
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:29,167
I spent like a month as a dragon after I left that kingdom.

143
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,442
-What!?
-Why!?

144
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:36,125
My mind was taken over by the blaze dragon's thought pattern. I couldn't change back.

145
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,832
I might've stayed a dragon the rest of my life...

146
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,199
That's serious trouble!

147
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,893
Why'd you risk becoming a dragon, then! ?

148
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,106
Mm....

149
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:51,022
I just thought it'd make for a cooler exit than walking out y'know?

150
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,169
Okay, yeah, it was pretty but still...

151
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,416
How does that remotely matter!?

152
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,608
So... How'd you turn back?

153
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,581
Mm..

154
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:07,246
I finally found you.

155
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:24,724
The capital was in an uproar over the prelate seeing an orc turn into a dragon.

156
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:27,629
It's all the people are gossiping about.

157
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,532
I can see this has gotten out of hand.

158
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:38,616
For goodness' sake!

159
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:40,482
TSUNDERE-SAN!!

160
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,250
"Fell-fire” huh!!?

161
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,516
Time for a fireproofing spellcard!

162
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,071
Not much punch huh...?

163
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,014
In the end...

164
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:59,035
You're a pale imitation!!

165
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:18,063
Y'know, I think this is the first proper fantasy-world fight I've seen so far.

166
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:21,445
B-but I've been fighting plenty!

167
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:26,502
Yeah, and all your fights are either "win instantly” or "get hanged"...

168
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,645
Don't you... 'Rawr' at me!!

169
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:46,678
Stupid...!

170
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,422
You know...

171
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:55,456
You're just fine as an orc!

172
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,773
Well, well, well...

173
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:20,330
!?

174
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:24,529
Rumors were abounding of an orc shifting into a giant dragon...

175
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:30,488
I came out with some sellswords for a hunt, and here, I find it already captured by our very own customer!

176
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:32,023
The Regfalgen company..!

177
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,507
Heh heh..

178
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:34,993
Is this fate?

179
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:39,431
Should you hand him over alive you'll be handsomely rewarded.

180
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:44,590
Perhaps not as handsome a sum as what you owe us.

181
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:47,602
Oh, speaking of that...

182
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,763
..will you be able to pay us back..?

183
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,551
I said I'd repay it.

184
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:54,592
You're putting the screws to me when I'm not even in arrears?

185
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,201
You'd think a company president would have more composure.

186
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,718
Ohh!!

187
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:03,237
Spoken like a true daughter of the elga royal family...!

188
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:09,650
Truly, how fortunate I am to be graced with such wisdom in comporting myself as befits a superior.

189
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:13,615
You hear that!!? She graced us with her wisdom! Record what she said for posterity!

190
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:19,045
“Hewwo, I'm a debtor pwinkess, and I'm a vewwwy big deal!” Did I get that right?

191
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,606
Bwa ha ha ha!

192
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,698
Elf-san was a princess this whole time!?

193
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:22,696
Uh, Yeah.

194
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,987
You know that's a huge deal, right!? She’s royalty! An actual, bona fide princess!

195
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,036
It’s not quite that rare, you know...

196
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,264
Valgar was a prince, and Serena was descended from royalty too.

197
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,441
-That's a video game!!
-Gamee!!

198
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,305
What's your point?

199
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,698
That's the point!

200
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,349
...you did your research on me, huh?

201
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,584
All our largest customers, prin-

202
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:45,237
Don't call me "princess."

203
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:48,580
-Heh heh heh

204
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:48,816
I might be in your best interest to start actin’ nice so you get treated better later.

205
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,674
Pri- n- ce- ss

206
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:03,800
-Gya ha ha ha

207
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,712
None of that now, Lady Elf.

208
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,802
This is a dark pactcard.

209
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:11,615
We made a blood pact in the name of the spirits. No violence is allowed between contract parties.

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,056
You have two choices
— either pay off your debt

211
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:16,866
and be released or go
into arrears and be mine,

212
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:17,916
Heh heh heh

213
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,357
You were a bit careless in offering yourself up for collateral..!

214
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:26,271
A marital connection to elven royalty is sure to open new doors for the company..!

215
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:31,268
The name Hagen Regfalgen will become known through out-

216
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:32,696
KURICHELGID RIOLRAN

217
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,903
Oh....

218
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,972
You snapped me out of the dragon shift, didn't you?

219
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:42,689
Y-Yeah

220
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:43,520
Hi again.

221
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:48,120
I dunno what's going on, but I just returned the favor, right?

222
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:48,822
Uh?

223
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:50,754
Okay bye.

224
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,603
Hold it right there!

225
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:54,924
Gh..

226
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,301
Oh for..! Why are you like this!?

227
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,989
Uh, you might not wanna touch me. It's been a long time.

228
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,108
It's only a month!

229
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,276
I haven't had a bath for a whole month...

230
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:05,463
You don't smell funny, okay?

231
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,334
You haven't smelled me up close.

232
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,574
I did while you were sleeping, actually!

233
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,914
Ah!

234
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:12,695
What? Why?

235
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,259
N-Not like that! It wasn't intentional I was hugging...

236
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,600
I mean...

237
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:22,298
I smelled you when I was trying to strangle you...!!

238
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,539
Oof..!

239
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,441
What a strained excuse...

240
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:27,991
Oh, that makes total sense.

241
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,790
Boy, I came this close to getting strangled to death...

242
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:33,067
That's seriously how he perceives it...

243
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,402
As usual he and tsundere-types are like oil and water...

244
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:43,854
You broke the debt pact I used spell-card to forge!? M-My plans....?

245
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,941
Just who is that orc!?

246
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,576
-What the hell is your relationship!?

247
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,094
Debt? what?

248
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:51,608
Wh-what relationship does it look like we have...!?

249
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,770
Oh, shut the hell up!!

250
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:56,438
Boss...

251
00:14:56,603 --> 00:15:02,763
If the pact is out of the picture... Can I teach the chick some manners now?

252
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,919
DOLDOLL
THE GIANT
HUNTER!

253
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,149
I was really lookin’ forward to huntin’ a dragon...

254
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,420
This little sideshow's pissin’ me off...!!

255
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,587
I deserve a little fun, y'know...?

256
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:15,957
Me too!

257
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,745
-Gotta put that uppity elf-maid in her place!

258
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,117
You brought this on yourself, Lady elf...

259
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:24,454
A painful lesson might be a more suitable reminder of your place.

260
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:27,208
I'm not as nice to my enemies as orc-face over here.

261
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,050
Can you beat this army?

262
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,891
In the blink of an eye,

263
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,639
Huh?

264
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:36,889
Huh?

265
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:42,766
This the cosmite ring. They say only seven of these exist in the world.

266
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,313
A rarity like this is worth alot of money.

267
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,842
I don't want this...

268
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,817
I didn't know she owed you money...

270
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,553
We're square, right?

271
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:52,769
Wait...

272
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,616
Right? This is a token of my sentiment..

273
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:56,597
What?

274
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:06,049
I went to all those lenghts to buy it back...

275
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,317
H M M M M . . . ?

276
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,593
Scary!!

277
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:20,630
Tch...

278
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,341
Watch out!

279
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:27,974
Eww!

280
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,705
A swamp! Mud!

281
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,436
What now, boss?

282
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,816
J-Just leave them!

283
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,810
Who wants an elf drenched in mud anyway!? I want nothing to do with her!

284
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,094
Damn iiit!!

285
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:45,590
It won't come off!

286
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,129
Congrats, sir..

287
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,627
Congrats, sir

288
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,373
Stop celebrating, you nincompoops!!

289
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:53,975
Withdraw.

290
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,346
Whoops...
Guess the ring was too small for him.

291
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,419
But seriously going into debt-? What were you thinking?

292
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:02,878
What do you expect?

293
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:05,925
I didn't have enough to buy this back!

294
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:09,079
Huh!? That's the ring I gave you!

295
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,260
I liquidated that for you!

296
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,262
Look..

297
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,715
Sheesh, What a waste!

298
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:17,466
You don't need to wear precious metals.

299
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,679
Shut up stupid orc!

300
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:22,413
You look pretty enough already.

301
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,027
..what?

302
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,710
You're drenched in mud!

303
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:33,464
Filthy orc!
Mud-orc!

304
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:35,290
If anyone's muddy, It's you!

305
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:41,273
You're right.

306
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:47,206
You can't even tell which one of us is the orc or the elf now!

307
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:50,397
Heh heh heh...

308
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,306
I've had enough of being dirty.

309
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,458
I want a hot bath today.

310
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:59,822
Ah... This is a volcanic area. It's got hot springs.

311
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,714
Whoa.. Really!? Where!?

312
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,665
That way.

313
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:08,661
You know, I've noticed you seem weirdly fixated on staying clean.

314
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:11,445
I take a bath at least once a day.

315
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:16,047
A seasoned adventurer could go a whole month with no baths and not complain.

316
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,234
Ehhh

317
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:18,111
Like me...

318
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,618
Oww! That hurts!

319
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,459
What!

320
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,165
You see how she used violence on me, totally unprovoked...

321
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:31,761
He deserved that...!

322
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,218
I saw the look he gave her...!

323
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,062
I hate to admit it, but the elf played a huge part in turning me back.

324
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:42,918
So-! The fantasy world has hot springs too, huh?

325
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,081
Oh yeah, I took a soak after that.

326
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:46,733
Oh, nice...

327
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,935
When it’s this cold, I could go for one myself...

328
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:55,420
It's 10°C in august!?

329
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,447
It's way too cold!

330
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,504
Uncle, turn off the AC spell for a while!

331
00:18:59,019 --> 00:18:59,904
Sure.

332
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,225
I could open a window.

333
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,162
No... We'd better not. If that rubbed the ice spirit the wrong way...

334
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,805
Mankind would perish..!!

335
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:22,488
Why does mankind go extinct from opening one lousy window anyway ...!?

336
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:26,594
Can we buy an AC please? I'll chip in, if money's an issue.

337
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,714
No! I have my pride as a youtuber.

338
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,085
Stay out of this, you bargainbin influencer!

339
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:36,130
Aha! Couldn't you cut the cold air with your “sword of darkness spell?

340
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,432
Oh, I don't think it works like that...

341
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:42,038
What if we just drop the magic and buy an ac unit already?

342
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,208
Takafumi, Give me your cell.

343
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:45,981
Yes

344
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,081
Spirit of darkness-

345
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,648
Become a blade and revel the form.

346
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:55,453
Look.

347
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,119
No signal. Whoa!

348
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,509
It's cut both the wi-fi anf the phone network signal!

349
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:01,418
That's nuts!

350
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,673
The sword of darkness severs power flows, like magic or radio waves.

351
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,806
I haven't tried with this but...

352
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:12,936
..It should be able to cut IR transmissions too.

353
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:16,010
IR's little outdated...

354
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,144
Bluetooth!

355
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,981
Sure. Let's see the port! Where's your bluetooth port?

356
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,736
There is no port for that.

357
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:28,163
Oh, I get it! It's related to Blu-Rays, right?

358
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,747
Not at all! Ha ha ha

359
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:38,242
It was surprisingly fun huddling and chatting under a blanket in a frigid room amid the sweltering august heat.

360
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:42,269
Summer this year is fish every day.

362
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:15,864
It's awful.

363
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:18,255
A parasite monster...

364
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,794
Must have gotten from a river fish or something.

365
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:22,409
What an awful way to go...

366
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:25,115
I didn't know a stomach could do that...

367
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:26,678
Urk...

368
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:31,357
Huh!?

369
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:32,918
Orc-face!?

370
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:34,910
You can't just barge into others room like that!

371
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,048
It's an emergency.

372
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:38,009
Wha..?

373
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,301
Hwuh?

374
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,928
Good. Nothing there

375
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:54,564
Someone got infected by a parasite monster. If you're infected, there should be a visible sign of it on the stomach.

376
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:56,734
Ah... Is that what

377
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,314
You big, stupid dummy, let me go!

378
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:10,828
MAAABEEELLL?

379
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,447
I didn't do anything!

380
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:13,020
As for you! Don't you dare ever...

381
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,094
Something's in my stomach-

382
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:22,985
St-Stop

383
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,142
Stop the video!

384
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,045
Uncle stop!

385
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:33,804
Now, then.. We were supposed to have fish for lunch.

386
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:36,134
I can't. No way in the hell.

387
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:40,207
Okay, So what's for lunch?

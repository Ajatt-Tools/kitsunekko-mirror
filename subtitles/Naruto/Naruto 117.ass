Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.39,0:02:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,,That was a close one.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.56,0:02:16.25,Default,,0,0,0,,But... I was able to throw it off\Njust a little.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.35,0:02:18.67,Default,,0,0,0,,There's no mistake.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.69,0:02:22.76,Default,,0,0,0,,He's now realized the secret\Nof the Byakugan.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.19,0:02:47.06,Default,,0,0,0,,I see... That Chakra!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.06,0:02:50.34,Default,,0,0,0,,He was emitting Chakra\Nthe whole time
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.34,0:02:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,and covered the area surrounding him!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.72,0:02:56.13,Default,,0,0,0,,And in a wide range to that extent.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.73,0:02:59.98,Default,,0,0,0,,No wonder he was able\Nto detect the arrow and
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.98,0:03:03.17,Default,,0,0,0,,throw off the trajectory of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.71,0:03:11.52,Default,,0,0,0,,But constantly emitting that\Nmuch Chakra is a death throe...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.89,0:03:15.55,Default,,0,0,0,,If he doesn't go that far,\Nhe can't dodge.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.55,0:03:17.61,Default,,0,0,0,,In other words, there's no mistake.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.93,0:03:19.48,Default,,0,0,0,,It's as I hypothesized...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.00,0:03:24.07,Default,,0,0,0,,The arrow earlier was\Ntotally invisible to him!

Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.56,0:03:31.99,Default,,0,0,0,,And from the results,\Nhe accurately examines the information.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.52,0:03:43.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And... he's also discovered\Nthe weakness of my eyes...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.05,0:03:44.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Impressive.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.32,0:03:49.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Of all the enemies\NI've fought until now,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.59,0:04:17.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Because he couldn't see them!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.39,0:04:22.96,Default,,0,0,0,,In other words, even his Visual Jutsu\Nhas a slight blind spot!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.02,0:04:27.27,Default,,0,0,0,,Being unable to see Kunai Knives\Nentering that blind spot,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.27,0:04:28.68,Default,,0,0,0,,he's unable to react.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.28,0:04:31.94,Default,,0,0,0,,So he was dealing with attacks\Nfrom the blind spot
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.94,0:04:34.31,Default,,0,0,0,,with that defense technique.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.07,0:04:38.95,Default,,0,0,0,,And I analyzed all the attacks\NI carried out

Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.87,0:04:44.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Right behind his first thoracic vertebra...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.42,0:04:47.89,Default,,0,0,0,,there exists a blind spot expanding\Nfrom a very small point.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.01,0:05:02.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Indeed, if he moves and\Ndoesn't stabilize the blind spot,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.89,0:05:05.95,Default,,0,0,0,,it becomes difficult to aim there\Nwith an arrow.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.95,0:05:09.34,Default,,0,0,0,,But such a trick... doesn't fool me!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.19,0:05:15.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Gentle Fist is pointless if\Nyou don't come close to your enemy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.33,0:05:20.10,Default,,0,0,0,,And you can't afford to think about\Napproaching me at this point.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.58,0:05:22.48,Default,,0,0,0,,It's about how to escape now...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.33,0:05:27.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Though whether you struggle or not,\Nyou're going to die anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.27,0:05:36.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Heh... It seems you only\Nhave a little Chakra left.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.76,0:05:40.89,Default,,0,0,0,,The fate of the small fry character\Nin an easy game
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.89,0:05:42.92,Default,,0,0,0,,is to be destroyed right away!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.85,0:05:47.92,Default,,0,0,0,,It's useless!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.42,0:06:58.66,Default,,0,0,0,,A thread?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.01,0:07:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I see, with this thread...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.64,0:07:09.04,Default,,0,0,0,,This time, the trajectory was thrown off\Nslightly by the trees, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.29,0:07:19.25,Default,,0,0,0,,If that's the case...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.25,0:07:22.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll add some rotation this time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.82,0:07:24.53,Default,,0,0,0,,So even if it hits a tree,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.53,0:07:28.43,Default,,0,0,0,,it'll just cut through and the trajectory\Nwon't be thrown off.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.43,0:07:30.70,Default,,0,0,0,,And as before...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.70,0:07:34.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll control the arrow up until\N1 50 feet away from him
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.00,0:07:35.82,Default,,0,0,0,,using a thread with Chakra\Nflowing through.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.25,0:07:38.60,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll take aim at the moving target...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.46,0:07:41.66,Default,,0,0,0,,and plunge the arrow into\Nthe blind spot with a pinpoint attack!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.81,0:07:47.58,Default,,0,0,0,,He's still standing up?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.31,0:07:52.07,Default,,0,0,0,,He's strong...\NHe's much stronger than me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.69,0:07:55.76,Default,,0,0,0,,I hardly have any Chakra left now.

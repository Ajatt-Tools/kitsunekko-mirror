Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.76,0:06:06.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Then...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.21,0:06:09.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Then we should stop and hide to ambush them!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.34,0:06:10.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Ambush?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.85,0:06:11.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.85,0:06:15.90,Default,,0,0,0,,If we ambush them, we'll have an advantage.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.19,0:06:20.68,Default,,0,0,0,,It might work if we catch them off guard!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.25,0:06:22.72,Default,,0,0,0,,We can't do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.24,0:06:27.48,Default,,0,0,0,,They're the men of the former Konoha ninja, Orochimaru.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.48,0:06:30.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Worst case is that there is a Jounin among them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.58,0:06:35.20,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought that would've worked... But it won't.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.54,0:06:37.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Wait a moment, why?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.81,0:06:41.66,Default,,0,0,0,,The enemy's level doesn't matter when you're ambushing them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.66,0:06:43.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so why?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.17,0:06:47.17,Default,,0,0,0,,You guys sure don't understand, do you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.17,0:06:52.22,Default,,0,0,0,,It's true that ambushing is a really advantageous basic tactic...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.22,0:06:55.66,Default,,0,0,0,,But to pull it off, there are two conditions you must meet.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.66,0:06:58.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And what are those conditions?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.64,0:07:04.88,Default,,0,0,0,,First, the runner must move silently, and must discover the enemy first.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.53,0:07:12.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Second, we must secure a location to catch the pursuers off guard and inflict critical damage to them...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.05,0:07:15.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and quickly conceal ourselves in that location.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.87,0:07:22.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Once we're able to fulfill those conditions an ambush becomes a valid tactic.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.55,0:07:29.20,Default,,0,0,0,,If we have the ninja dog's nose, we can find their location pretty easily.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.80,0:07:37.17,Default,,0,0,0,,As for the second one, it seems that we're at an advantage since this is our village, and we know the terrain better...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.84,0:07:41.14,Default,,0,0,0,,But Orochimaru has been in Konoha before.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.14,0:07:43.68,Default,,0,0,0,,If we're dealing with his men, that method won't work.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.86,0:07:46.69,Default,,0,0,0,,So what are you trying to get at?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.06,0:07:54.12,Default,,0,0,0,,The pursuers have been taught about the terrain and have most likely gone through training for this battle.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.12,0:07:59.20,Default,,0,0,0,,On top of that, they are all most likely ninja who have mastered the art of pursuing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.75,0:08:02.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So they know how we'll act.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.38,0:08:06.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Ambushing is still advantageous, but\N there are too many uncertain factors.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.86,0:08:14.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, the enemy is a squadron organized specifically for this plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.63,0:08:17.50,Default,,0,0,0,,As for us, we have an idiot...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.06,0:08:20.75,Default,,0,0,0,,a female ninja who has no special traits...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.31,0:08:22.50,Default,,0,0,0,,a dog...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.06,0:08:26.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and the number one coward, me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.23,0:08:34.00,Default,,0,0,0,,A strategy is devised by understanding the situation, and creating the best plan for that situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.00,0:08:35.25,Default,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.25,0:08:38.31,Default,,0,0,0,,There's only one thing we can do right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.87,0:08:39.79,Default,,0,0,0,,One thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.46,0:08:43.40,Default,,0,0,0,,A feint operation that looks like an ambush.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.83,0:08:48.67,Default,,0,0,0,,One person will stay behind, set up things to look like an ambush and stop them.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.42,0:08:53.17,Default,,0,0,0,,So... play the decoy?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.55,0:08:55.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.39,0:09:00.67,Default,,0,0,0,,If the person can stop them, they won't be able to get the location of the other three.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.43,0:09:06.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Then we can lose the pursuers, but the decoy will most likely...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.86,0:09:10.83,Default,,0,0,0,,die.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.52,0:09:45.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So, who wants to take the job?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.53,0:09:56.27,Default,,0,0,0,,We need the dog to look for Sasuke, which means...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.23,0:10:05.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, I'll...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.77,0:10:07.45,Default,,0,0,0,,...the only choice left is me.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.67,0:10:09.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Shikamaru?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.08,0:10:10.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Why you?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.76,0:10:14.63,Default,,0,0,0,,It's better than being annihilated.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.22,0:10:21.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Also, the only guy who can pull of this decoy perfectly and have a high chance of surviving withing this group...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.02,0:10:26.01,Default,,0,0,0,,is me.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.61,0:10:33.93,Default,,0,0,0,,The Kagemane no jutsu was originally made to stop the enemy anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.95,0:10:37.23,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll catch up with you guys later.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.86,0:10:39.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Hurry up and go.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.56,0:10:47.13,Default,,0,0,0,,We're counting on you, Shikamaru!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.94,0:10:51.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Sakura-chan...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.34,0:10:56.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:04.68,0:11:08.31,Default,,0,0,0,,Was Shikamaru such a reliable guy?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.69,0:11:16.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Be careful... Shikamaru.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.32,0:11:47.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Even if you can mask your presence...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.91,0:11:51.33,Default,,0,0,0,,we see you.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.92,0:11:59.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Hey, the enemy is getting closer and closer.

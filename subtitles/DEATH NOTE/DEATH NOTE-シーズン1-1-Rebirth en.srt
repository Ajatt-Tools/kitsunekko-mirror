What do ya say? Come hang out with us,
pretty lady.

172
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,206
[Lady] Please, I don't want any trouble.

173
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,625
[Takuo] You hear that?
She doesn't want trouble.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,668
<i>Isn't that cute?</i> [laughs]

175
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,920
[loud heartbeat]

176
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,671
[whimpers]

177
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,841
[Takuo] Let's go, boys.
Strip her down right here.

178
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,926
Are you sure?

179
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,386
-[Takuo laughs]
-[Lady] No! Stop!

180
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,055
Please!

181
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,932
[screams] Help me!

182
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,600
[thugs whooping]

183
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,895
TAKUO SHIBUIMARU
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

184
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,439
[Light] <i>Now, what will happen?</i>

185
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,943
[Takuo] Hey, wait up!

186
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,569
Takuo, look out!

187
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,951
[screaming]

188
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,953
[Light gasps]<i> That settles it.</i>

189
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,830
<i>The Death Note...</i>

190
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,456
<i>It's for real!</i>

191
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,999
[thug 1] Oh man!

192
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,709
-Takuo!
-[thug 2] Stupid kid,

193
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,587
he just came outta nowhere! [screams]

194
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,508
[Ryuk] Now then,

195
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,385
I'd better get going.

196
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,241
[Ryuk] It's been five days.

197
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,493
Now then,

198
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,245
I'd better get going.

199
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,831
Eh? You headed somewhere, Ryuk?

200
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,626
Hate to tell you, but our whole world
looks like this. [chuckles]

201
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,213
That's true, but I've dropped
my Death Note.

202
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,798
[laughter]

203
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,134
You really messed things up, didn't you?

204
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,385
Hold on a sec.

205
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,263
Didn't you already trick the Old Man
to get a second book?

206
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,307
Don't tell me you dropped both of them.

207
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,768
You must have some idea
where you dropped the thing?

208
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,021
[Ryuk] Yeah, the human world.

209
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,564
[Deridovely and Gook] What?!

210
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,510
[Sachiko] What a nice surprise!

211
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,512
I wasn't expecting you home so early.

212
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,680
[Light] Yeah.

213
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,266
Hi mom. It's because…

214
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,517
Huh?

215
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,062
Oh...

216
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,272
the results of the nationwide exams.

217
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,649
I've been waiting all day.

218
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,567
Here.

219
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,070
Goodness! Number one, again!

220
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,364
These are the highest scores you've had.

221
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,615
[Light] Yeah, I guess.

222
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,284
I'm going to study in my room,
so please don't interrupt me, ok?

223
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,577
As you wish.

224
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,828
Oh Light,

225
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,956
do you want anything at all, dear?

226
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,666
You can ask for whatever you like.

227
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,793
No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks though.

228
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,756
<i>I've already got what I want.</i>

229
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,514
[chuckles quietly]

230
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,019
[laughs maniacally]

231
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,319
[Ryuk] You've taken quite a liking to it.

232
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,990
[screams]

233
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,704
No reason to act surprised.

234
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,956
I am the Shinigami, Ryuk.

235
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,000
That used to be my notebook.

236
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,043
Judging by your laughter,

237
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,295
you've already figured out

238
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,880
that what you have
is no ordinary notebook.

239
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,680
[Light] Shinigami,

240
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,724
a God of Death, huh?

241
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,270
Well, I'm not surprised. In fact…

242
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,272
Ryuk...

243
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,358
I've been waiting... for you.

244
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,901
Oh?

245
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,822
[Light] I've already figured out that
this Death Note that I've found is real.

246
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,324
It didn't take me long.

247
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,951
And now that I've witnessed
the proof of its power,

248
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,163
I only feel more confident
what I'm gonna do.

249
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,789
That's interesting.

250
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,667
I certainly wasn't expecting this.

251
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,546
Several Death Notes have made their way
into the human world in the past,

252
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,382
but you're the first
to have written this many names.

253
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,345
Look at how many people
you’ve killed in only five days.

254
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,805
Most are reluctant to write this much.

255
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,558
I've already prepared myself, Ryuk.

256
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,103
I used the notebook even though
I knew it belonged to a Shinigami,

257
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,813
and now that Shinigami has come.

258
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,149
So, what will happen to me?

259
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,109
You're here to take my soul, right?

260
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,986
Hmm, what do you mean?

261
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,740
Is that some fantasy
you humans came up with?

262
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,326
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

263
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,288
The notebook becomes
part of the human realm

264
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,457
from the very moment it touches the earth.

265
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,919
In other words, the notebook is now yours.

266
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,129
[Light] This… is mine?

267
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,091
If you don't want it,
just give it to someone else.

268
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,343
But if you give it away,
I'd have no choice

269
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,804
but to erase your memories
of the notebook.

270
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,014
So, then, you're saying

271
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,934
I can use the Death Note all I want
and I won't be punished?

272
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,769
Let's just say this,

273
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,188
you will feel the fear and pain

274
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,649
known only to humans
who have used the notebook.

275
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,069
And when it's your time to die,

276
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,989
it will fall on me to write your name
in my Death Note.

277
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,200
Be warned,

278
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,244
any human who's used a Death Note

279
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,622
can neither go to heaven nor hell
for eternity.

280
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,208
That's all.

281
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,545
[Ryuk laughs]

282
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,758
Now you have something
to look forward to after you die.

283
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,345
-[gasps]
-[Sachiko] Light?

284
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,972
It'll be alright.

285
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,223
Answer it.

286
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,810
What is it?

287
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,353
I thought you'd like some apples.

288
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,480
The neighbors brought them over for us.

289
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,732
Why on earth is it so dark in your room?

290
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,402
-You'll ruin your eyesight!
<i>-</i>[Light] <i>What's going on?</i>

291
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,737
<i>Mom can't see him?</i>

292
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:52,410
[Ryuk] That notebook you found
originally belonged to me,

293
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,245
and since you're now using it,

294
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,747
you are the only one able to see me,

295
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,332
and of course, my voice

296
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,084
can only be heard by you.

297
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,294
In other words,

298
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,088
the Death Note is the bond
between Light, the human

299
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,132
and Ryuk, the Shinigami.

300
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,594
Mhmm.

301
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,887
Yum.

302
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,014
I just have one more question
I wanna ask you.

303
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,391
-[Ryuk chomping]
-Why was I chosen for this?

304
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,686
Hey, are you even listening?

305
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,897
[swallows]

306
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,025
Apples in the human world
are worth the trip.

307
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,194
What's the best way to describe these?

308
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,403
Juicy?

309
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,572
Just answer my question?

310
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,407
[scoffs] I didn't choose you.

311
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,118
Don't you see?
This is all just an accident.

312
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,788
You actually thought you were chosen
because you're so smart or something?

313
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,582
Don't be so vain.

314
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,586
It just happened to fall around here,
and you just happened to pick it up.

315
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,171
And that's all there is to it.

316
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,715
That's why I wrote the instructions
in English,

317
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,134
the most popular language
in the human world.

318
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,428
Then why did you drop it
in the first place?

319
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,639
You even wrote down specific instructions,

320
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,807
so don't try telling me
this was an accident!

321
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,018
You're asking me why?

322
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,687
I did it 'cause I was bored.

323
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,106
You were bored?

324
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,111
[Ryuk] <i>The truth is Shinigami haven't got</i>
<i>much to do these days.</i>

325
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,406
<i>Most of the time we're either taking naps</i>
<i>or gambling.</i>

326
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,201
<i>If you take the time to write names</i>
<i>in your Death Note,</i>

327
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,912
<i>the others just laugh at you</i>
<i>for working so hard.</i>

328
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,623
<i>Even if you wrote the name</i>
<i>of another Shinigami,</i>

329
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,791
<i>it'd be pointless</i>
<i>because they wouldn't die.</i>

330
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,086
<i>And since we live in the Shinigami Realm,</i>

331
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,714
<i>it brings us no amusement to kill those</i>
<i>in the human world either.</i>

332
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,678
<i>So, I figured I'd have more fun</i>
<i>if I came down here myself.</i>

333
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,808
Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names
you've written,

334
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,810
but I wanna know why you only wrote

335
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,521
the cause of death for that guy
who was hit by the truck.

336
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,523
If you don't write down
the cause of death,

337
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,149
the victim dies of a heart attack,

338
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,778
and that's probably the best thing
about the Death Note, Ryuk.

339
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:51,988
Huh?

340
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,783
You see, I've already exhausted
the list of the world's major criminals,

341
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,286
and eventually,
I'm going to get rid of them all.

342
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,788
What's the point of doing that?

343
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,832
It's only a matter of time
before people figure out

344
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,126
that these criminals
are being eliminated by someone.

345
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,671
I want the world to know of my existence.

346
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,967
That there's someone out there
passing righteous judgement on the wicked!

347
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,678
Why even bother?

348
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,681
What are you trying to achieve
by passing judgement on them.

349
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,933
I mean, why do you care?

350
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,643
Because…

351
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,687
I've been bored too.

352
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,692
I wasn't ready to believe it at first,

353
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,193
but it's obvious now.

354
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,070
There's something
about the Death Note itself

355
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,615
that makes humans want to try it out
at least once.

356
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,327
<i>I killed them both.</i>

357
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,246
<i>I really… I killed two men.</i>

358
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,540
<i>Those were human lives,</i>

359
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,500
<i>it won't be overlooked.</i>

360
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,044
<i>Besides,</i>

361
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,338
<i>who am I to pass judgement on others?</i>

362
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,968
<i>No, no wait.</i>

363
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,219
<i>Maybe I'm wrong.</i>

364
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,805
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what I've been thinking about lately.</i>

365
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,432
<i>This world is rotting,</i>

366
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,143
<i>and those who are making it rot</i>
<i>deserve to die.</i>

367
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,937
<i>Someone has to do it, so why not me?</i>

368
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,066
<i>Even if it means sacrificing</i>
<i>my own mind and soul,</i>

369
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,233
<i>it's worth it.</i>

370
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,610
<i>Because the world...</i>

371
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,654
<i>can't go on like this.</i>

372
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,448
<i>I've wondered…</i>

373
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>what if someone else</i>
<i>picked up this notebook.</i>

374
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,786
<i>Is there anyone out there, other than me,</i>

375
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,622
<i>who would be willing</i>
<i>to eliminate the vermin from the world?</i>

376
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,831
<i>If I don't do it,</i>

377
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,458
<i>then who will?</i>

378
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,918
<i>That's just it; there's no one,</i>

379
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,294
<i>but I can do it.</i>

380
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,088
<i>In fact,</i>

381
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,964
<i>I'm the only one who can.</i>

382
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,175
<i>I'll do it,</i>

383
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,802
<i>using the Death Note,</i>

384
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,553
<i>I'll change the world.</i>

385
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,477
[groaning]

386
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,897
[groans]

387
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,163
[screaming]

388
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,375
[screaming]

389
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,219
[Light] <i>At first, I wrote the names</i>
<i>of the worst criminals I could think of.</i>

390
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,264
<i>Like I was cleaning up the world,</i>
<i>one name at a time,</i>

391
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,851
<i>so that eventually no one will ever</i>
<i>do anything evil again.</i>

392
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,646
<i>And while the truly guilty ones who</i>
<i>deserve to be punished for their crimes</i>

393
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,022
<i>die of heart attacks,</i>

394
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,109
<i>the people who are less guilty</i>
<i>but who still make trouble for others</i>

395
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,028
<i>will slowly be erased</i>
<i>through disease and accidental death.</i>

396
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,197
<i>Then, and only then,</i>

397
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,533
<i>the world will start moving</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

398
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,579
It'll be a new world, free of injustice,
and populated by people

399
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,623
who I've judged to be honest,
kind, and hardworking.

400
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,878
But if you did that, it would make you
the only bad person left.

401
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,047
Huh? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

402
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,508
I'm a hard-working honor student

403
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,094
who is considered to be one of Japan's
best and brightest.

404
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,389
And I…

405
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,602
I will become the God of this New World.

406
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,065
<i>It's just as I thought,</i>

407
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,651
<i>humans are so interesting.</i>

408
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:31,874
TO BE CONTINUED

00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:05,812
subs: ersby

3
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:37,853
(child's voice)
The soap bubble flew

4
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:40,936
It flew up to the roof

5
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,006
But when it got to the roof

6
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,009
It burst and disappeared.

7
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:14,661
Who's there?

8
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:31,489
Sister? 
What was that?

9
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,675
Help!
 Anyone!

10
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,441
An ambulance! Quick,

11
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,642
get an ambulance!

12
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,433
It's the police!

13
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:04,502
What happened?
 Open the door!

14
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:05,928
Ishibashi-san!

15
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,122
Please open the door!

16
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,410
Are you okay?
I heard a scream.

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,430
- There was a man...
- Is he still here?

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,100
- But my daughter-in-law was attacked. 
Please help.
- Let me see.

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,300
- It's the police. 
Do you need an ambulance?
- I called for one just now.

20
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:39,515
The bleeding seems to have stopped.

21
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,156
Don't move her.

22
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,126
Are...

23
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,076
Are you okay?

24
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,196
Where did the criminal go?

25
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:14,989
There's been an break-in.
One person injured.

26
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:17,646
The criminal is on foot so he can't have gone far.

27
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,196
Get a team down here now.

28
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:29,222
What do you think?

29
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:34,062
We found a set of fingerprints
from someone not in the family.

30
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,064
- The criminal's?
- We don't know yet.

31
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:38,063
We found them on the doorknob.

32
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,219
And footprints were found by the back door,
about 30cm in length.

33
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,269
So I'd say he's quite a tall man.

34
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:58,133
- What are you doing?
- Just putting these in the proper order.

35
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:01,203
Ah! No. 
I'll put them back.
Sorry.

36
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:08,634
In this house, there's myself, 
Shoko, and 
my granddaughter, Rin.

37
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,078
Three people.

38
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:14,048
So, last night, Rin's classmate Mika was
staying with here?

39
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,034
And you were always upstairs.

40
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:19,020
Yes, the two of us were in Rin's room.

41
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,093
Fumie-san, you spent the evening
in your room at the back?

42
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,110
Yes.

43
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:25,210
When we heard Shoko screaming

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,280
we all came rushing out at the same time.

45
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,027
I caught a glimpse of the man as he ran away.

46
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:40,959
Help!
 Anyone!

47
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,116
I see. But none of you were able to see
this man's face?

48
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:51,052
My sister saw someone in the street.
Probably the same man.

49
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,074
But she didn't see his face either?

50
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:56,044
That's right. 
Only that he had a strong physique.

51
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,709
But... 
I did see him.

52
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,079
What?

53
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:03,031
- He looked like someone I know.
- Who?

54
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,985
He's been following me around. He's
a stalker.

55
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:09,020
Do you know his name?

56
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,073
I don't know, but it's definitely him.

57
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:16,127
Last night I saw him acting weird...

58
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:17,447
Sorry, Rin.

59
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:21,247
It's my fault he came to your house.

60
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,170
Can you describe this man?

61
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,209
Hey... what's this food for?

62
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:38,245
- This is... 
- It's an offering to the guardian angel of the 
Ishibashi house.

63
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:43,004
- So... you must be from...
- We're from Iwate. 
- My God!

64
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:47,041
So this is for the Zashiki-Warashi?

65
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:50,094
- What are you on about now?
- Huh?

66
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:53,047
That's right. 
I left an offering of red beans

67
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,037
But the intruder knocked over all these things.

68
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:59,057
You're worried that this will
make her leave this house?

69
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:02,106
That's right. 
After such a terrible incident...

70
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:04,996
I don't understand a word either of you are saying!

71
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:08,029
Zashiki-Warashi is a famous legend in Iwate.

72
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:14,038
It's a child-like spirit and you can 
hear its footsteps in the middle of the night or 
feel it sitting on your futon.

73
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,020
It likes jokes and tricks.

74
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,074
It is an old legend, strongly believed
in sumo circles.

75
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,119
Sumo?

76
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,085
It is a spirit that protects the house, so 
when a Zashiki-Warashi leaves, then 
the family is said to go into decline.

77
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,035
Otonashi!

78
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:31,135
This ridiculous drivel has to stop now.

79
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,955
On the night of the incident, in my house...

80
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:38,059
Zashiki-Warashi appeared to me.

81
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,169
Shibayama...

82
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,030
what's the latest on the victim?

83
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,117
She's still unconscious in an intensive care unit

84
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:47,650
I'm sorry, Rin.

85
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,237
It's all because of me...

86
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,192
Mika...

87
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,141
No.

88
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:58,029
It's not your fault. 
This is...

89
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:03,134
caused by the Zashiki-Warashi leaving the house
because she was unhappy.

90
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,768
That's right.

91
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,354
I agree.

92
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:11,042
- Zashiki-Warashi?
- Yep.

93
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:14,045
Is this Tsukiko's new theory?

94
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,450
If it was just Otonashi, I could cope.

95
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,032
There's someone else?

96
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:25,076
- The victim's mother-in-law, 
Fumie-san, also believes in it too. 
- The Zashiki-Warashi?

97
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,061
There's no reason why she should.

98
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:31,045
The husband doesn't live with them any more?

99
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:34,065
- He eloped with another woman.
- Eloped...

100
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:38,136
In other words, the victim was living with

101
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,206
the mother of the man who left her?

102
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:48,195
She's such a good wife.

103
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,652
Even after my son left her,

104
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:55,036
she allowed me to stay in the house.

105
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:57,121
A kind person, indeed.

106
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:02,191
And she works hard in the flower shop she owns.

107
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,728
She had quite reputation locally for...

108
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,067
the beautiful bouquets of flowers she made.

109
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,085
- Is this okay?
- It's lovely!

110
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:15,155
Ah, such a terrible thing...

111
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,993
We'll definitely catch the criminal.

112
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:23,097
And we'll bring the Zashiki-Warashi back
to your house.

113
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,049
- Right, Katsuura?
- Eh?

114
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:29,120
I don't know where she is right now but
I'll find her and

115
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,190
- She'll return to the Ishibashi household.
- Officer...

116
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:47,155
If you're still in the neighbourhood

117
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:50,225
could you let yourself be seen?

118
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:54,112
We've bought red beans.
And some candy, too.

119
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:56,182
- But there's no-
- Shh!

120
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,137
She may still be near.
 Let's look, Katsuura.

121
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:06,207
- Really...?
- Come on!

122
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,278
Wait...

123
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:16,034
Hang on...

124
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,089
Hello! Lovely weather, isn't it?

125
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,038
Hello.

126
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:23,007
Please, give it a rest, Tsukiko-san.

127
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:27,148
- Where could she have gone?
- She doesn't exist.

128
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,998
Ah, Tsukiko-san?

129
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:34,138
Okay, we start by finding Yoshi Mika's
stalker. Let's go!

130
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:36,188
Sir!

131
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:42,026
(phone rings)

132
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,046
- What the hell?
- Even my mobile!

133
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,118
Hello?
 They hung up?

134
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:51,119
- What was that?
- Aah!

135
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:54,189
My PC is doing stuff it shouldn't!

136
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:57,193
What the Hell's going on?

137
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,062
Is this a joke?!

138
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:03,531
Ah! My receipts!

139
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,033
Aaagh!

140
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:09,053
- What is it, Shibayama?
- Just there!

141
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,072
What was just there?

142
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,974
- Sitting here...
- What was?

143
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,042
Shibayama-san?

144
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:18,249
Ah, forget about it.

145
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,205
Shibayama!
 Shibayama!

146
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,823
Rin-san, have you ever seen the Zashiki-Warashi?

147
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,875
Officer, do you really believe in that?

148
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,857
Hm?

149
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,826
It's just some old wives' tale.

150
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,779
There's no way it could be true.

151
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,916
But last night I saw it myself.

152
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:59,986
By the way... who collected all this Sake?

153
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,009
- That guy.
- What guy?

154
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,814
That guy who ran away with a woman.

155
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,830
Your father.

156
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,952
He's not my father any more.

157
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:17,022
Ah, it's like that, is it?

158
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:25,850
Did the stalker follow you at a particular time?

159
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,851
Not really.

160
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:31,753
When I was leaving school, I'd turn around and
 I'd see him following me... 
sometimes.

161
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:34,856
- Weird.
- Yes.

162
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,862
There's nobody at home, so I'd take
my time going back.

163
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40,895
Being home alone was a little scary.

164
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:44,849
Did you report it to the police?

165
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,922
But 
they couldn't investigate since he hadn't hurt me.

166
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:53,972
Maybe if they'd have done something then,
the attack wouldn't have happened.

167
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,998
What's going on here?

168
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:02,887
Hey, there's a banana up there.

169
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:04,239
So there is.

170
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,158
Oi!

171
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:09,807
- What have you done?
- It wasn't us.

172
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:10,832
Look out!

173
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,496
Why did you stack the chairs up?

174
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:16,714
Tannai-san didn't do this?

175
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,767
Why would I do something like this?

176
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:22,737
I don't play childish games!

177
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:24,798
perhaps...

178
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:27,520
have other strange things been happening here?

179
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:31,295
Ando's PC started acting odd.

180
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,351
And all the prank phone calls.
 It must have been you!

181
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:37,351
I've got it!

182
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:42,376
- The Zashiki-Warashi has found someone they like
and followed them here.
 - Another fairy tale?

183
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:45,329
The Zashiki-Warashi is known for
it's playful spirit.

184
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,364
There's no such thing as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit!

185
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:49,413
- Right, Shibayama?
- What?

186
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,483
Yes, that's right, Otonashi.
They don't ex-

187
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:55,487
Aaagh!

188
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,523
Now what is it?

189
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,450
What's up?

190
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:02,543
What are you doing?

191
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:09,565
Your partner's acting a little strange.

192
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:12,504
Shibayama!

193
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:20,311
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

194
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,314
Did you see something?
Was something there?

195
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,400
We've found him!
 We got Yoshi Mika's stalker!

196
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,373
He's called Miura, he's 22, and he works in
a computer centre.

197
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,292
We caught him on the road to Mika's school.

198
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:34,378
He was following her. 
He's now in the interrogation room.

199
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:36,413
- Got it. 
Shibayama, let's go.
- Sir.

200
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:37,572
And you.

201
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:41,298
Put this back the way it was.

202
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:44,318
Huh? Why me?

203
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,371
- Work hard.
- This doesn't seem fair.

204
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:49,390
- Shibayama.
- Sir!

205
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,426
What happened here?

206
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,559
I hate it when people play jokes.

207
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:02,319
I admit, it was me who sent her those messages.

208
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,438
But to attack someone...

209
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,508
I couldn't!

210
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,297
Why am I the only one cleaning up?

211
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,316
- Why is that, huh?
- That goes there.

212
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:15,402
- Just here?
- What kind of body did the stalker have?

213
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:17,334
Pretty well built, I'd say.

214
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,341
- But the criminal has 30cm feet.
- That's huge.

215
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,456
That's it!

216
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:25,526
That would solve everything.

217
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:31,348
- I don't think it's him.
- Right.

218
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:34,488
At the time of the crime, he has witnesses
placing him at the computer centre.

219
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,588
What is it?

220
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,513
Tannai-san, look.

221
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,633
Shibayama?

222
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,479
Shibayama.

223
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
What's wrong?

224
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:10,522
Oi! Oi!!

225
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:17,444
Feel free to go on ahead of me.

226
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,514
Are you feeling okay?

227
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,575
What the...

228
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:39,484
Who are you?

229
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:42,196
Are you lost?

230
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,621
What's your name?

231
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:50,602
This is now the third victim.
You have to get your arrests quicker.

232
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:55,498
You're not in trouble, but
if you don't say anything...

233
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,386
Gohara-san.

234
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,974
Ignore it. 
Keep walking.

235
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,106
Sir.

236
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,522
Miura Seiichi can't be the stalker.

237
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,323
He has a perfect alibi.

238
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,408
- Throw this away.
- Sir.

239
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:25,432
We need to find the man seen running
away from the Ishibashi household.

240
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,482
Yes, sir.

241
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:32,286
Tsukiko-san. 
Are you busy at the moment?

242
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:36,323
Sorry, but I'm in the middle of
something important.

243
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,325
What's wrong?

244
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:41,348
We've got a serial killer who's just
got their third victim.

245
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,330
A three-victim serial killer?!

246
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,386
Shibuya, Shinjuku and Ginza.
Same method each time.

247
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:48,388
Well, you can ask any one of us.

248
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:52,356
No, I wanted Tsukiko's help in particular.

249
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:55,342
But if you're busy...?

250
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:58,328
- Sorry about that.
- I see.

251
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:00,481
- See ya.
- But...

252
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:02,190
Is that okay, Gohara-san?

253
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,601
They're just wasting our time.

254
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:18,565
What happened that's making you sigh like that?

255
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:19,747
Ah, Tsukiko.

256
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:24,321
You're the ace of the investigation team.
It doesn't seem like you.

257
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:29,757
It's this serial killer case. 
Each of the victims was a fortune teller.

258
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,766
Fortune teller?

259
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:36,233
And the more I get into it, the more there is about
Feng Shui and barriers and all kinds of stories.

260
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,682
I'm out of my depth.

261
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:39,555
Barrier...

262
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,069
Feng Shui...

263
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,857
- And that's why you asked for me?
- Well... yeah...

264
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,659
It can't be helped.

265
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:51,182
The police are amateurs in the
face of these things.

266
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:54,232
- Even Gohara-san struggles.
- Hm.

267
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,271
I understand.

268
00:17:57,522 --> 00:18:01,973
Once I solve the case of Zashiki-Warashi, 
I'll help you out.

269
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:04,776
- Ah. I see.
- Until then, I suggest

270
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:07,545
you work hard on the crime scene searches.

271
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:12,303
As they say, an investigation is just
searching the same place 100 times.

272
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:14,285
Goodbye.

273
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:18,355
Well, I was encouraged but now I feel uneasy again.

274
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:19,393
It's fine.

275
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,475
Just leave it to me.

276
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:31,436
Ah, Gohara-san!

277
00:18:35,342 --> 00:18:38,442
I'm starting to understand how Tannai-san feels.

278
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,948
If we can't find the Zashiki-Warashi
then how can we get it back to the house.

279
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,967
And if we can't bring it back?

280
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:50,357
There'll be no peace in the Ishibashi house.
There must be a way.

281
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:54,258
In the Ishibashi-san house something seemed
 a little odd.

282
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:57,261
About the bottles of Sake.

283
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:00,281
Ah, the bottles that you tidied up?

284
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,349
But I put them all back again.

285
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,607
- The point is, some of them had been drunk.
- What?

286
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,277
From when we did the forensics to now, three
bottles have been finished.

287
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:12,326
That many?

288
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:16,396
It is a lot, for such a short amount of time.

289
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:19,465
Katsuura,

290
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:24,255
you keep asking if I'll go for a meal with you.

291
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,240
Let's go now.

292
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,294
What? 
Really?

293
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,278
That's okay?

294
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:33,664
- Yes! 
Finally!
- Shibayama-san?!

295
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,387
- Do you have a second?
- No, we don't!

296
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,537
- I need some advice.
- We can't.

297
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:39,688
Right?

298
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:43,891
What did you want advice about?

299
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:47,011
Please don't tell Tannai-san.

300
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:49,046
Well, okay...

301
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:50,965
Ever!

302
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,007
Okay.

303
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,968
What's wrong?

304
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:57,171
I can see her... 
I think.

305
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:59,241
What do you mean?

306
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:03,160
What can you see?

307
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,230
A small girl.

308
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:09,033
- With short hair.
- Is that it?

309
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:11,018
Wait, could this be...

310
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,070
- With a brown kimono.
- It is!!

311
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,746
No doubt about it.

312
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,324
That's the same girl that I saw.

313
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:20,394
- Huh?
- Of course.

314
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,332
What? 
What what 
what what?

315
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,402
What?

316
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:34,341
- Did you see her?
- Absolutely.

317
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:38,411
It looks like the Zashiki-Warashi
likes you, Shibayama-san.

318
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:43,250
Otonashi, what should I do?

319
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,304
I think you should go back to the Ishibashi house.

320
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:51,258
Er, I could see it too.

321
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:53,260
What?
 You could too?

322
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,282
I can see these kinds of things.

323
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:57,598
Look, there! 
A girl with pigtails!

324
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,967
- Where?
- Just there!

325
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:02,853
- Where is she?
- Katsuura...

326
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:06,841
When I'm discussing these things
please don't interrupt.

327
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:09,010
It gets on my nerves.

328
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Sorry about that.

329
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:17,802
- What should I do, Otonashi? 
- For a start, let's try to find out why the spirit
 left the Ishibashi house.

330
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:20,955
- Why it left?
- Something must have happened...

331
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:24,150
so that now the spirit refuses to
return. But what?

332
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,976
- Shibayama?
- Those are the rumours.

333
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,076
He was seen talking to a wall.

334
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,846
Good morning.

335
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,749
- Morning.
- What's wrong?

336
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,603
Shibayama, we should go for a drink tonight.

337
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,573
Yes.

338
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:53,725
Oh, and 
Otonashi asked me to tell you 
she'll be a little late today.

339
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:56,795
She met a jinmenken while out investigating.

340
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,395
Ah, a "jinmenken" is a dog, but
 with the face of a person and...

341
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,736
Shibayama, come on!

342
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,806
Get a hold of yourself!

343
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,161
Sir...

344
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,626
Are you okay?

345
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:15,029
Really?

346
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,099
It's you!

347
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,103
It seems we meet again.

348
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,856
Hello.

349
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,825
- You know each other?
- Why are you here?

350
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,914
And why do we keep meeting?

351
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,868
Well, maybe it's just fate.

352
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:39,787
We were talking about the inn where
you can meet the Zashiki-Warashi.

353
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,840
Eh? You mean the one in Iwate?

354
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,881
That's right. 
They say seeing the 
Zashiki- Warashi brings good fortune.

355
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,797
Hara Takashi stayed there

356
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:54,273
and soon afterwards became prime minister.

357
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:56,005
We should go there, Tsukiko-san, together!

358
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,756
Unfortunately, it burned to the ground.

359
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:01,829
This gentleman was telling me about
when he stayed there.

360
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,861
- Really?
- Yes.

361
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:06,884
- Did you see her? The spirit?
- Well, actually...

362
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:09,801
I didn't even hear her footsteps.

363
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,856
Before I forget, I'd like to ask...

364
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:14,856
We still don't know your name.

365
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:18,627
Well, I hope the Zashiki-Warashi comes back soon.

366
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,697
Me too.

367
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,147
It's lonely without her.

368
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:27,802
Do you know who it is a spirit of?

369
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:30,888
Maybe.

370
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:35,863
It might be my sister, who died when she was six.

371
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,011
I see.

372
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:54,061
Your sister became your guardian.

373
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,017
So that's why you leave offerings every day.

374
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,836
Huh? He's done it again!

375
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,938
He just vanished!

376
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:07,196
- Suddenly disappears, huh?
- Definitely suspicious.

377
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:13,831
- Is Rin at home today?
- I think so.

378
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:18,920
Recently we haven't been talking

379
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,990
- so I don't know for sure.
- What's wrong?

380
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:28,978
"Why don't why try again" I said.

381
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:33,801
My son wants to come back.

382
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:36,854
When he eloped, it was fine at first

383
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:38,856
but they soon split up.

384
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:45,930
We had to decide if we should give
him another chance.

385
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,922
Shoko-san was still angry.

386
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:50,050
But Rin was worse...!

387
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,838
I'll never forgive that man.

388
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:56,808
- Rin...
- Grandma, you're being selfish.

389
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:59,977
He may be your son, but...

390
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:03,047
think of mother's feelings.

391
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:13,758
That's what she said.

392
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:16,828
Not a chance.

393
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:22,834
As for me, he's still my only son, even if 
he's not so sweet.

394
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:26,788
How tall would you say your son is?

395
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,874
- 178cm
- Katsuura.

396
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:32,960
Has he recently visited you at your house?

397
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,030
Perhaps sneaking in through the back door?

398
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:41,003
Where is your son now?

399
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:59,837
Are you Ishibashi Manabu-san?

400
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:02,957
Drinking so early?

401
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,027
Who are you?

402
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,897
Look out!

403
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,967
Wait!

404
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,926
It wasn't me!
I haven't done anything!

405
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:23,996
Then why were you running away?

406
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,099
It's true.

407
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,851
I have been to the house several times.

408
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,907
But neither Rin or Shoko wanted to meet me.

409
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:35,856
So you became violent?

410
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:38,976
- No.
- The footprints at the door

411
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:42,046
match the pattern on your shoes.

412
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:47,889
Yes, I went to see them that night.

413
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,756
But there was some kind of commotion inside,
so I didn't go in.

414
00:26:52,826 --> 00:26:54,876
Don't lie to me!

415
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,946
Your fingerprints were on the bottle that
was used as a weapon.

416
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:05,153
The Sake there all belonged to me.

417
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,942
Of course it'd have my fingerprints.

418
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:10,992
Yes. 
Although I didn't see the face

419
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,934
he is similar to the man I saw that night.

420
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:22,113
Okay. 
That's settled.

421
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,064
Yep.

422
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,931
You are Rin's father?

423
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,001
And who are you?

424
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:44,809
Did you ever meet the Zashiki-Warashi?

425
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,844
- What?
- Because apparently

426
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:51,849
- it's now in the police headquarters.
- Eh?

427
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,902
This is all new to me.

428
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:55,972
I see.

429
00:27:56,623 --> 00:27:59,022
It doesn't show itself to you.

430
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,844
But that was a pretty daring thing you did.

431
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:08,883
To go back to the house the day after the attack.

432
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,019
We noticed that...

433
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,089
the Sake went down after one day.

434
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:18,944
Oh, that.

435
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,848
Rin?
 It's me, Mika!

436
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:26,867
Why won't you answer my calls?
 Hey, Rin?

437
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:28,853
Mika?

438
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,922
Ah, officer.

439
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,505
Rin won't let you in?

440
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:35,043
Right. 
And she won't answer my texts.

441
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:39,814
By the way, Mika,

442
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,917
- Did you really see him?
- Huh?

443
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,050
Did you really see a man running away that night?

444
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,011
I saw it.
 Why?

445
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:56,948
Nothing.
 Just a routine check.

446
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,834
And the stalker is solved?

447
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,837
Yes. It seems the police scared
him away.

448
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,339
That's good.

449
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:07,009
Excuse me.

450
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:30,015
Hey, wait! 
Hey, I want a word!

451
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:34,018
Somehow, it had closed the curtain!

452
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:40,925
Wait!

453
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:43,995
What's that idiot playing at now?

454
00:29:48,903 --> 00:29:52,937
- You don't see it, Tannai-san?
- What?

455
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:56,007
- Nothing.
- Shibayama!

456
00:29:56,927 --> 00:30:01,866
Wait! Wait!

457
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,956
Wait a sec...

458
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:28,004
I should've guessed, 
Zashiki-Warashi can run really fast!

459
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,810
Phew, I'm all sweaty.

460
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:52,814
Hm. This one.

461
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,653
What?

462
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:03,640
You're cutting your nails!

463
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,642
So what?

464
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:09,841
Is this about the proverb on cutting your
fingernails at night?
 but it's not evening yet.

465
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,735
- What day is it today?
- It's Friday.

466
00:31:15,705 --> 00:31:20,985
The thing is, cutting your fingernails on Friday
means your heart will be broken.

467
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:24,631
- So the saying goes.
- Cut that out.

468
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:28,665
Ah!

469
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,650
Wh... 
What's that?

470
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,652
A child?

471
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:35,672
Where's that singing coming from?

472
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:38,728
This is...

473
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:47,802
Shibayama.

474
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:50,653
Shibayama!

475
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:53,640
What's happened to you?

476
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,775
You have to get a grip!

477
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:59,845
I thought we were partners.

478
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:03,817
Stop messing around.

479
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,755
Shibayama's totally lost it!

480
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:11,641
What did you just say?

481
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:13,663
Ah, no.
 I wasn't talking to you.

482
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,645
Then who were you talking to?

483
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:17,330
Behind you...

484
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,717
They can't see it, Shibayama-san.

485
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:23,673
- Can't see what?
- Otonashi, you said you wouldn't tell!

486
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:26,639
I know. 
The Zashiki-Warashi.

487
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,376
This stupid story again!

488
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:33,813
That kind of thing just doesn't happen.
Right, Shibayama?

489
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,636
Shibayama?

490
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:42,639
What?
 You're kidding me!

491
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:46,659
The Zashiki-Warashi seems to like him.

492
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,646
So where is it now?

493
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,631
Sorry, but...

494
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:55,602
I don't want to see it.
I don't want to believe it.

495
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:58,621
We cannot chose the things that we see.

496
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:00,912
Otonashi. Is this fun for you?

497
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:04,611
- Yes!
- I've never seen her so happy.

498
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:07,697
And now...

499
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,650
it's getting too playful...

500
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,674
and I understand the circumstances
at the Ishibashi home, in the area...

501
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:17,727
I want to perform a ritual to return
the spirit to its home.

502
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,642
Ritual?

503
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:23,746
Shibayama-san, would you like to join me?

504
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:27,066
- If you want, you can all come.
- Over my dead body!

505
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:41,811
Ah, it's a half moon tonight.

506
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:48,755
(doorbell)

507
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:50,973
Who is it?

508
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:53,109
It's Tannai.

509
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,112
- Come in, everyone.
- Thank you.

510
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:58,647
Why are you wearing an apron.

511
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:00,166
Did you make this?

512
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,101
Yes. 
Please sit down.

513
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:04,456
I've prepared some snacks and drinks.

514
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:06,355
Make yourself at home.

515
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:09,441
Treat the place like your own.

516
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,511
- Excuse me.
- Please sit down.

517
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:17,867
On the night of the incident I was just
here, having a nap.

518
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,152
I woke and suddenly there -

519
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:22,238
- What?
- was a girl.

520
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:24,808
Don't scare me like that.

521
00:34:25,277 --> 00:34:30,146
Just there we have the Zashiki-Warashi's
favourite: red beans and rice.

522
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:33,050
As well as candy and toys.

523
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,255
The sort of things a small girl would like.

524
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:40,305
- Then, what should I do?
- If you could sit here please.

525
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,144
And lift up both hands.

526
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:47,339
Oi, Shibayama. 
Shibayama!

527
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,899
Shibayama-san?

528
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:52,369
It's almost time.

529
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:55,181
Well, 
then, 
everyone.

530
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:57,322
If you'll excuse me...

531
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,394
Is she asleep?

532
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,554
She's sleeping.

533
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:14,841
Only an idiot can fall asleep that fast.

534
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,863
We're reproducing the events of that night.

535
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:20,847
So you say.
Nice room, though.

536
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,899
What?

537
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:24,954
And Tsukiko's sister's quite pretty.

538
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:27,004
Er, thank you.

539
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:31,992
Well, don't mind me...

540
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,979
Recording.

541
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:37,847
Don't we need eight glasses?

542
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,849
Huh? Seven's enough.

543
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:47,773
Look.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

544
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:51,844
- See? We need eight.
- But there's only seven of us.

545
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:54,901
Where's the eighth person? Eh?

546
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:58,953
Shh. Quiet.

547
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:17,003
Zashiki-Warashi.

548
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,810
- She's here!
- Shibayama, stop that.

549
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,942
Sorry, sir!

550
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:27,012
I think I can sort of see something.

551
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Sorry.

552
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:38,925
Why won't you go back to your original house?

553
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:41,044
You've appeared before us.

554
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:44,045
What do you want to say?

555
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,956
Eh?

556
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:57,226
Tsukiko-san, what did Zashiki-Warashi say?

557
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,949
Could it be...?

558
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:10,356
Tsukiko-san?

559
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:12,158
Shibayama.
Wake up!

560
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:13,543
Wait. 
Tsukiko-san!

561
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:14,865
Shibayama!

562
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,497
Fumie-san!
 It's Otonashi!

563
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:25,574
Open the door, please!

564
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:32,762
- Ah, Tsukiko-san.
- Where's Rin?

565
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,847
She should be up in her room.

566
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:37,117
Excuse me.

567
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:44,354
Rin?

568
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:45,741
Are you there?

569
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:48,210
Don't come in!

570
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,680
Rin, open up!

571
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:52,430
I said don't come in!

572
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,519
No!

573
00:37:58,473 --> 00:38:00,473
Stop!

574
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:05,561
Why would she...?

575
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:09,431
You really can't forgive, can you, Rin?

576
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:12,501
that's why you...

577
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:24,363
On that night, I saw Zashiki-Warashi in my home.

578
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:27,333
It wasn't deserting your home

579
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:30,903
But left to tell me about the danger.

580
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:36,291
And the same thing happened tonight.

581
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:40,479
Zashiki-Warashi knew about Rin being in danger...

582
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:43,549
and told me about it.

583
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:46,736
That can't be true.

584
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:49,104
I saw it too.

585
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:52,174
- Shibayama.
- The girl with the short hair.

586
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:54,547
On that evening,

587
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,904
the man running to the back door
of your house never existed.

588
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,051
Isn't that so, Fumie-san?

589
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:03,233
Didn't exist?

590
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:06,055
But her friend said she saw him.

591
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:11,126
That was a lie.

592
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:18,196
This man was invented on the spot.

593
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:23,122
I spoke to your son about it.

594
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:28,192
The amount of Sake decreased in a day.

595
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:32,181
Oh, that...

596
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,051
I was throwing it away.

597
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:38,053
Huh? Throwing it away?

598
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:43,025
I wanted it out of the house, for Shoko.

599
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:47,046
- That Sake.
- What do you mean?

600
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:55,054
When I ran away, she began drinking more.

601
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,619
She became drunk...

602
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,010
and violent.

603
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,131
The commotion caused that night
was your mother, wasn't it?

604
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:09,201
In front of your friend, Mika.

605
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:18,174
When she drank too much, she'd turn
into another person.

606
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:29,989
Why is it me that ends up like this?

607
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,157
Shoko-san, calm down.

608
00:40:32,227 --> 00:40:35,227
Rin has a friend round. Okay?

609
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,262
Mother-in-law.

610
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:42,051
You dare say that to me in my own house?

611
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:44,039
Are you saying I should forgive your son?

612
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:49,058
That I should forgive him after everything he's done?

613
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:54,063
On hearing this, Manabu-san didn't enter the house.

614
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,131
Enough!

615
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:58,050
- Mother!
- What're you doing?

616
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,002
Get away from me!

617
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:04,089
- Mother!
- All of you, go away!

618
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,295
Stop it! 
Stop it, mother!

619
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,390
Help!

620
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:17,302
Anyone!

621
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:21,106
When I heard someone calling, I came running.

622
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:26,176
Fumie-san, the lie was your idea, wasn't it?

623
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:30,049
It's the police!
 Open the door!

624
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,519
Ishibashi-san!

625
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,218
Open the door!

626
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:36,288
A lie to protect your granddaughter.

627
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:43,051
Are you okay? 
I heard a scream.

628
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:46,031
- There was a man...

629
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:48,170
- Is he still here?
- But my daughter-in-law was attacked.

630
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,220
- Please help.
- Let me see.

631
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,690
- It's the police.
 Do you need an ambulance?
- I called for one just now.

632
00:41:56,128 --> 00:42:01,046
The bleeding seems to have stopped.
Don't move her.

633
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:03,098
Are you okay?

634
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:05,168
Where did the criminal go?

635
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:15,060
Listen, Shoko-san was attacked by a man

636
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,045
who escaped out that door.

637
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:22,034
Rin, you did nothing wrong.
Nothing at all.

638
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:24,036
Understand? 
Okay?

639
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,988
Fumie-san's story

640
00:42:26,058 --> 00:42:29,024
was used by Mika-san to frame her stalker.

641
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:31,026
He looked like someone I know.

642
00:42:31,096 --> 00:42:34,113
He's been following me around. He's
a stalker.

643
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:39,183
But Rin never lied.

644
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:46,223
Her mother had been hurt, and she couldn't
forgive herself.

645
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:50,129
So she attempted suicide.

646
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,199
Because...

647
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:59,171
there wasn't a man there...

648
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:09,159
I'm the one who hurt her.

649
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:17,221
Just a small lie, but it brought you such pain.

650
00:43:18,076 --> 00:43:20,125
That's why Rin

651
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:24,195
stopped contacting her friends.

652
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:26,333
Sorry.

653
00:43:27,484 --> 00:43:30,233
I'm sorry, Rin.

654
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:35,040
(ringtone)
Whose is that?

655
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,111
Oh, it's me.

656
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:42,047
Hello. 
Ah, Iwata, 
what's up?

657
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:45,050
Hm, is that right?

658
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,282
We'll talk later.

659
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:49,154
We've got the case all wrapped up here.

660
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:52,224
Hm. Yes.

661
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:55,412
Rin-san.

662
00:43:55,763 --> 00:44:00,262
Your mother's regained consciousness.

663
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:05,203
She conscious?
That's good news, Rin.

664
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:20,068
Can I go and see her?

665
00:44:20,138 --> 00:44:22,087
Well, now

666
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:25,160
As long as you don't attack anyone or
try to kill yourself, it should be okay.

667
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,210
Do you promise?

668
00:44:29,114 --> 00:44:31,129
I promise.

669
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:35,699
Shibayama.
 Take these two to the hospital.

670
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:42,107
Shibayama.

671
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:44,177
Sir.

672
00:44:45,263 --> 00:44:47,263
Let's go, grandma.

673
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:52,573
Tsukiko-san.

674
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:56,054
Many many thanks.

675
00:44:56,124 --> 00:45:01,059
Everyone, thanks to you too.

676
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:04,129
- Don't mention it.
- Take it easy.

677
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:07,199
- Yes.
- Let's go.

678
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:25,033
Are you cold?

679
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:27,002
I'm fine.

680
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:31,089
- It's good that she'll be discharged soon.
- Isn't it?

681
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:34,009
And as for my son, Manabu,

682
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,032
He was finally able to apologise to her in person.

683
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:40,065
Will Rin be able to forgive her father?

684
00:45:40,135 --> 00:45:43,151
Well, that may not be so easy.

685
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:45,057
But it's been a long time since

686
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:50,161
- I've heard her say "Father."
- Is that right.

687
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:53,261
A real happy ending.

688
00:45:55,417 --> 00:46:00,418
What?
 I'm sure I tied these properly.

689
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:04,488
This too?

690
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:08,310
Huh??

691
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,363
Now I'll really do it properly this time.
Good.

692
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,365
What the...?!

693
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:18,386
It looks like she's back to her old ways.

694
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:21,456
Okay. Eehh?

695
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:28,450
So it looks as if the Ishibashi home will be safe.

696
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Yep.

697
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:49,337
- What's that?
- Woah, you gave me a shock.

698
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:51,286
Stop doing that.

699
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:54,359
When you get a message from someone you like,
 it can be a good luck charm.

700
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:57,308
From someone you like?
What do you do?

701
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:59,344
- Will you do it?
- I'll try it!

702
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:04,382
But Tsukiko-san, I've had all these charms,
and none of them seem to work.

703
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:06,401
- Really?
- Huh?

704
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:10,355
Hello, Tannai-san and friends.
We need to find this man.

705
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:12,340
That's...

706
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,330
We think he's a witness to the
fortune teller murders.

707
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,399
At each location, after the incident,

708
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:19,267
we have testimony saying he was there.

709
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:21,366
Why do I know this face?

710
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:23,455
Wait a second. Tannai-san, you
know this man?

711
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:25,505
Where was it?

712
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:29,527
This... Tsukiko-san.

713
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:53,531
It can't be... him?

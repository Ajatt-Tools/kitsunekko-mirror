1
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:29,435
Hm?

2
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,434
This is...!

3
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,276
What do you think, Tannai-san?

4
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:56,278
What?

5
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:58,230
These mysterious bite marks.

6
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,265
I'll send it for examination

7
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:03,251
to discover if it's from a person or not.

8
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,738
- What else could it be?
- A stray cat?

9
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:08,193
- A cat that eats cucumber?
- Some of them do.

10
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,275
No, it's nothing like that.

11
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:13,679
Are you saying it's the bite marks of a Kappa?

12
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:17,065
Amazing!
You're starting to think more like me!

13
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,035
No, I'm not...

14
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:21,069
That's why we always got along so well.

15
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,155
No, no.
 Not at all.

16
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:27,225
It is my opinion that moat has Kappa!

17
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:34,082
Otonashi.
 It must be nice to be you.
You're always having fun.

18
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:36,101
I'm jealous.

19
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,658
I see, what you're saying is...
you wish you'd thought of it first.

20
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,160
That not what I'm saying!
I'd never say that!

21
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,210
Agh!

22
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,264
Not again...

23
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,069
(phone rings)

24
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,039
Yes!
 I see...

25
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,228
What?
 Murder at the TV station?

26
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,034
The victim was a staff member

27
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,089
Sugai Suichi.
 Forty five years old.

28
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,089
Time of death was between 11 and 2 last night.

29
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,144
He was working late on some technical tests.

30
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:19,061
Sugai...
Sugai...

31
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,047
What are these scratches on his neck?

32
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,002
Probably from when he was fighting the criminal.

33
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:26,221
And he died from a blow to the head.
Where's the weapon?

34
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,271
We haven't found it yet.

35
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:54,748
Katsuura, what are you doing?

36
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,699
Nothing.

37
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,782
There was dust and...
 Your collar!

38
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,874
Good work, everyone!

39
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,300
Ah, Tsukiko!

40
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:04,993
Why did you call the rest of Tannai's team, too?

41
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,925
What are you trying to say?

42
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,997
Shibayama, it's fine.
What was the victim working on?

43
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,962
Oh, er... right...

44
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:13,969
Until recently, he'd been working on
a variety show.

45
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,988
- Something about UFOs or psychics.
-  UFOs?!  Psychics?!

46
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:18,920
That's right, Tsukiko.

47
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,993
Recently he was transferred to the
transmission centre.

48
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,942
That explains it.

49
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:27,062
These are documents from that programme.

50
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,132
Take a look at these photos.

51
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,968
- Is that a ghost?
- Wow.

52
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,708
Katsuura...
why are you showing us this weird stuff?

53
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:40,011
At the time of death it seems the lights were out.

54
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,982
And in the dark, 
these terrible spirit photographs were by his side.

55
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:45,390
Can it be...

56
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:46,948
a curse?

57
00:04:47,018 --> 00:04:48,967
Shibayama!
Don't talk nonsense.

58
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:51,953
- Isn't this fake?
- Hm?

59
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,423
It doesn't seem like a real photo.

60
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:58,331
It's rare to find a power strong enough
to commit murder.

61
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:07,969
- I can't see! 
- Otonashi, what are you doing now?
- I want to know how it was when he died.

62
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,971
You're good at working this!

63
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,041
What?

64
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:15,961
This is the video the victim was watching

65
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,963
Tsukiko-san?

66
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,932
Look.
Tokyo Tower and the Skytree.

67
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,001
So what?

68
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,810
I've loved the Tokyo Tower ever since I was small.
- And so...?

69
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:31,008
Don't you know? 
On the site where the tower now stands there
 used to be a cemetery.

70
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,101
So now...

71
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:35,626
the tower is a centre for mysterious occurances.
 Apparently.

72
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:36,948
Which means...?

73
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,848
The will of the dead sleeping under the tower
 pulled on the tower and...

74
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,022
there's a legend that says
the tower is leaning slightly.

75
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:46,057
What?
Tokyo Tower's leaning?

76
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,859
That can't be true.

77
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:50,962
The Skytree will be opening soon

78
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:54,950
and it's rumoured that this has broken
a barrier in Tokyo.

79
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,088
Excuse me.
We've found bloodstains in the corridor.

80
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:00,138
- What?
Let's take a look, Watanabe.
- Sir.

81
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,129
This case may decide the fate of these two towers.

82
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,074
subs: ersby

83
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:24,095
raws: furransu

84
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:36,374
This is the person who found the body, 
Daisai Miyuki.

85
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:40,378
- I'm Tannai of the Investigation team.
- Shibayama.

86
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,965
Can you describe what you saw when you
found the body?

87
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:47,435
I work as an AD on a news program

88
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:52,907
Good morning!
I'm here to deliver the tapes!

89
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:57,929
This morning, I was taking the tapes round...

90
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,849
Sugai-san?!

91
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,919
(door opens)

92
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:17,932
I'm Sugai's brother, Hiroyuki.
I work as a journalist here.

93
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,788
- This is his-
- I'm Sayoko, his wife.

94
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:27,659
Is it true my husband was murdered?

95
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,832
- I'm Tannai from the investigation team.
- Shibayama.

96
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,882
Please.

97
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,475
When was the last time you saw your husband?

98
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,555
Last night.

99
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,415
At nine.

100
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,867
Where was that?

101
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,937
In the corridor.

102
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,756
You haven't seen him since?

103
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:01,760
He didn't come home last night.

104
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,915
I understand.
 He must be very busy.

105
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:05,015
No.

106
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:11,015
These days, we not really together.

107
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:13,845
I see.

108
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:16,908
So you left the station...?

109
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:21,928
Less than thirty minutes after that.

110
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,753
And when was the last time you spoke to
your brother?

111
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:30,739
Hmm, when was it...?

112
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:34,659
I'm a little busy.
 I didn't get any sleep last night.

113
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,762
Are you okay?

114
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,268
Ah, sorry.
I want to help with preparing the funeral

115
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,767
But I have to go soon.

116
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,853
Don't worry.
 It's fine.

117
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:49,758
With you brother working at the same TV station
you must see each other a lot.

118
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:50,728
Yes,

119
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,020
well,

120
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:54,796
we work on completely different shows.

121
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,749
Hiroyuki-san, which program?

122
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:00,661
The news documentary that goes out on Sunday.

123
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:01,659
You mean?

124
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,772
"There's just one truth"?

125
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:08,459
That's right.
 I'm working on it today.

126
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,659
Sorry, but if you have any
questions, feel free to call me.

127
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,436
I understand.

128
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,854
Excuse me for a second.

129
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:23,598
His brother dies, but he still has to work.

130
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:24,994
Must be tough.

131
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:28,799
You say that, but it's the same for us police.

132
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:32,750
Because I'm a cop,
I've had to sacrifice my private life.

133
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,968
Right.

134
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:34,938
Really?

135
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:37,939
We'll meet up tonight at my place.

136
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,587
Urban Myth forum meet!

137
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,343
Should be fun.

138
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:47,265
Of course, there are some cops
who won't sacrifice anything.

139
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,250
Yes.

140
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,770
Excuse me.

141
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,972
Excuse me please.

142
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:54,941
Now,

143
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:59,760
Why was your husband interested in the Tokyo
Tower and the Skytree?

144
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,299
I see...

145
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,199
he seemed to like Tokyo Tower.

146
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,954
Do you know the rumours?

147
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,973
Rumours?
What?

148
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:15,960
About the lights on the Tower at night.

149
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,131
If two lovers are looking at the Tower
when the lights go out, then that means...

150
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,968
their love will be everlasting.

151
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:26,071
Yes.

152
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:30,141
And this is how he got his women.

153
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,947
What?

154
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:46,157
This means we'll be happy forever...

155
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,133
This means we'll be happy forever...

156
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,655
How many women...

157
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:04,155
did he promise eternal happiness
while holding their hands? Hm?

158
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:10,031
I have to get back to work.

159
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,101
- Of course.
- Excuse me.

160
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,942
So it's like that, is it?

161
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:23,521
I'm slowly working it out.

162
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,014
What's that?

163
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:30,277
If you see the lights go out together,
 you'll be happy.

164
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:36,024
Exploiting such a nice urban myth is bound to
 make the Tokyo Tower angry.

165
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:40,061
- Pardon?
- Or to be exact...

166
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:45,131
the souls of the people under the Tower.

167
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,974
- Because of this, your husband-
- Otonashi, not again!

168
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:53,074
- Your husband-
- Get out, now.

169
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:55,144
I'll tell you later.

170
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Ah, and I really wanted to say it.

171
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:06,955
What's this?
Ah, Sugai-san!

172
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,028
It's been a long time, hasn't it.
Since the last case.

173
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,897
Wait a minute.
I've been trying to remember why I know that name.

174
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:15,964
Could it be you and the victim are...

175
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,967
We're brothers.

176
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:23,004
I'm sorry to hear that.

177
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,960
- We'll definitely catch the killer.
- I'll leave it in your hands.

178
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,062
Sorry, but I have people waiting.

179
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:30,112
Excuse me.

180
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,899
Do you know him?

181
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:38,953
He was a journalist who always seemed
to be in the right place.

182
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,926
Every year he'd win the prize for best news story.

183
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,691
- Well, it was mostly thanks to me.
- What?

184
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:49,914
- Each story he won the prize with was
 a case being lead by me.
- By you?

185
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,793
He was great to work with.

186
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,852
I'll definitely find the killer.

187
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:57,956
(phone)

188
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,958
Hello?

189
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:03,011
Yes? I see.

190
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,049
Gohara-san.
There's been a murder in Fuchu City.

191
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,001
What the hell.
It's one thing after another.

192
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,364
Tsukiko, can you let me know
of any developments here.

193
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:22,981
When I first met my husband we were both
still in our early twenties.

194
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,967
I quit my job to get married.

195
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,970
- Do you have children?
- We don't.

196
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,153
Besides,

197
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:33,891
he was always chasing other women,

198
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:37,946
Apart from the young woman earlier,

199
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:41,032
he was also dating an announcer.

200
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,602
An announcer?!..

201
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:44,152
Sorry.

202
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,956
Why is the program being cancelled?

203
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,941
That young woman!

204
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,977
Sugai, do you agree with her?

205
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,964
- Well...
- Excuse me.

206
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,866
- Is it true what they say?
- Huh?

207
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,447
Anything 
Bandou Eiji-san praises...

208
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:02,854
will be in demand.

209
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,956
Well...

210
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,996
But on the front cover of "The television"
he's holding a lemon.

211
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:11,029
- Is this his new talisman?
- Can it be?

212
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,969
I hear he started carrying that lemon around
to ease the tension of some famous actress.

213
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,969
I see.

214
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,971
Thanks for your help.

215
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,891
- Who are you?
- Officer Otonashi.

216
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:24,966
Tsumura-san.

217
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:27,980
I always watch
 "There's just one truth"

218
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:31,983
What is the meaning of this?

219
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:35,006
I wanted to ask about your brother and
the Tokyo Tower.

220
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,147
Otonashi.

221
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:39,057
What are you up to now?

222
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:41,127
Questioning.

223
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,947
- You are Tsumura Kaori-san, yes?
- Yes.

224
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:49,967
Could you tell us where you were between
11 and 2 last night?

225
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,021
Why are you asking her for an alibi?

226
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,058
We're been told that you went with Sugai-san

227
00:14:57,128 --> 00:15:00,128
and saw the lights of the Tokyo Tower go out.

228
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:04,065
An affair?

229
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:07,135
Do you think I'm a suspect?

230
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,992
Certainly, he took a lot of women there
since he separated.

231
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:15,943
Everyone knew about it.

232
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,930
At that time last night...

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,933
I was with him in the staff room.

234
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:25,937
- Isn't that right, Sugai?
- Yes.

235
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,972
Just the two of you?

236
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,859
There were no other staff in the building so
 we were alone together.

237
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,961
Is this right?

238
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,117
Yes, certainly.

239
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,132
Miyuki-san!
 Miyuki-san!

240
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,984
Did you know about that?

241
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:00,054
That Sugai-san and Tsumura-san were dating?

242
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:05,960
I'd heard they'd already split.

243
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:12,967
But Sugai-san usually went back to
women he'd split up with.

244
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,022
Doesn't sound like a good boyfriend.

245
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:18,973
But since he was moved from his old job

246
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:23,961
he seemed to become depressed.

247
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:28,986
A lowly AD like me compared to an announcer,
 there was no competition.

248
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,919
You said Sugai-san was depressed?

249
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:36,961
Because he was moved to a new department
and put in charge of the test broadcast.

250
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,996
Was that what he was doing last night?

251
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:43,742
The digital TV signal is still transmitted from
 the Tokyo Tower but...

252
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:46,988
from next year, it'll come from the Skytree.

253
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,972
So to prepare for the switch-over

254
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:54,959
we do test transmissions from the Skytree at night.

255
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,045
That's what he was doing last night.

256
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:04,115
Sugai-san was broadcasting from the Skytree?

257
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,957
Tokyo Tower is beautiful, isn't it?

258
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:13,978
- Is it tilting today?
- No way.
It doesn't tilt.

259
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,030
Before he died,

260
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,989
Sugai-san would often bring women here so he
could see the lights go out with them and say that

261
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,023
according to legend, they'd be
eternally happy together.

262
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:27,975
Wait.
Is that true?

263
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,946
And this made the Tokyo Tower angry.

264
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,881
And the Tokyo Tower's rival,

265
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,002
the Skytree, was recently being used
for test transmissions.

266
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:45,046
This brought forth the wrath of the
souls under the Tower.

267
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,948
Katsuura, has the murder weapon been found?

268
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:52,950
No, not yet.

269
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,090
As I thought.
 And it won't be found.
The murder weapon.

270
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Huh?

271
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:07,018
Sugai-san was not attacked by humans.

272
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,024
What's this?

273
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:53,995
It's a shame, but no matter how long we search

274
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,882
this case will never be explained.

275
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,985
Well, I guess...

276
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:03,037
After all, the victim

277
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:07,107
exploited that wonderful legend of the Tokyo Tower.

278
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:14,982
If you see the lights go out,
you always be happy together...

279
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:18,002
Let's try it, Tsukiko-san.

280
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:20,891
You shouldn't mess around with the magic of love.

281
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,958
When do they go out?
 It's now six...

282
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,961
The lights go out at midnight don't they?

283
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:29,033
We'll just have to wait.

284
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,850
- I'll leave you to it.
- Wait.

285
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,003
We have the forum meet tonight.

286
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,886
But we have to both see it, or it won't work.

287
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,224
Hey! 
Stop...

288
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,044
Go out! 
Go out!

289
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,014
Wait.

290
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,564
Are they even on?

291
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:53,785
The victim, Sugai Suichi-san was a womaniser.

292
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:55,840
Recently we know he was dating two women.

293
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,773
Daisai Miyuki, the AD who found the body.

294
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:00,745
And the announcer, Tsumura Kaori.

295
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:04,779
Both people have ID cards and so
they can come and go freely.

296
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,802
His wife, Sayoko-san, was preparing for a divorce.

297
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:10,788
She has a qualification in medical affairs
and was already looking for a new job.

298
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:13,788
Did we check what time she left the building?

299
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,758
No, the office doesn't keep

300
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:18,693
records of when people leave.

301
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:24,782
I see.
Well, it's definitely one of these three women.

302
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:27,785
See what else you can find out about them.

303
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:29,787
Sir.

304
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,773
- And Tsukiko?

305
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,876
- Where's she now?
- Who knows?

306
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:37,946
What kind of answer's that?

307
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,765
(doorbell)

308
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,884
Hellooo.

309
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,954
Cheers!

310
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:54,779
Tokyo Tower is made out of tanks, right?

311
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:57,819
That's right.
After the Korean war, old tanks were melted down

312
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,822
and used to make the steel frame.

313
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:04,742
But what about the theory that the Sky
Tree has broken a barrier.

314
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:08,860
- What do you think?
- Well, it could be the opposite.

315
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,618
They say that it's created another barrier.

316
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:15,767
Tokyo Tower,
Ikebukuro Sunshine and
the Skytree.

317
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:19,737
These three high-rise buildings form a triangle

318
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:22,774
around the Imperial Palace.

319
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:25,760
And this new barrier

320
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,781
will protect Tokyo and Japan.

321
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,749
Really amazing.

322
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:33,838
I really want to believe that's true.

323
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:36,771
That's right.
Me too.

324
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,773
Is it connected to

325
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:41,843
the picture of prophecy from the Edo period?

326
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:43,913
What's that?

327
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,770
You've never heard of it?

328
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,772
No...
sorry.

329
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:59,811
At the end of the Edo period,
Kuniyoshi Utagawa made a print

330
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:02,780
called "Caulking Boats".

331
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:09,774
In the picture, next to a watchtower, there's a
structure that looks just like the new Skytree.

332
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:13,775
Kuniyoshi Utagawa was able to draw
pictures of ghosts.

333
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:16,794
Maybe there are people who can see such things.

334
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:18,796
Prophecy?
 From Edo?

335
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:23,116
We're surrounded by invisible things,
if only we had the eyes to see.

336
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:26,939
Ah! I see it!

337
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:29,911
Dust.

338
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,765
- Take care.
- See you.

339
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,801
Learn about Kuniyoshi-sensei.

340
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,873
- I will.
- Really.

341
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Right, Katsuura.

342
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:54,398
First thing tomorrow morning,
we're going to the Skytree.

343
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:57,451
You've drunk too much.
Do you want some water?

344
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:59,470
Yep.

345
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Tokyo Tower and the Skytree.
What's their connection?

346
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,664
More importantly...

347
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:14,547
me and you....
What's our connection?

348
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:19,474
I'm home!

349
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:22,346
- Of course you are!
I was expecting you.
- What?

350
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:25,463
I was thinking it was about time you got back.

351
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,883
If you want, I can go for a quick walk.

352
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:31,953
- Hm?
- Come here.

353
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:41,779
- Katsuura, you're serious about my sister?
- Of course.

354
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:46,868
So it'd be better if you two were alone.

355
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:48,938
Huh?

356
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,759
Yes, but now Tsukiko's a bit drunk, so-

357
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:56,747
Hey, if she's drunk then I can...

358
00:23:56,797 --> 00:24:00,832
No, that's fine.
I'm off.

359
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,902
Sorry to bother you.

360
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:06,922
Thanks for having me...

361
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:12,912
Another chance wasted...

362
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,950
(the door locks)
Ah.

363
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,722
You were attacked?

364
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:26,791
Who's that?
Otonashi?

365
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:29,864
Yes. Seems she was attacked by
a slit-mouth woman.

366
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:31,762
Wow, that old story.

367
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:33,764
- Give me that.
- Sir.

368
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,750
Hello?

369
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,758
"The mental shock was enormous"

370
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:40,771
"the first time I saw her."

371
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:43,794
"She tapped on my shoulder and asked
if she was beautiful."

372
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:47,344
Otonashi! 
That's enough! 
She hung up!

373
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:48,580
Are you okay?

374
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,650
She hung up on me!

375
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,870
What's so funny?
 Are you laughing at me?

376
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
I'm not laughing.

377
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:04,779
Woah, that's tall.
 Like, really tall.

378
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:09,285
This is the first time I've seen it from so close.

379
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:09,285
 That's tall.
 Like, really tall.

380
00:25:09,336 --> 00:25:10,970
What's that?

381
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,612
What's that?

382
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,665
That's Sorakara!
Don't you know, Katsuura?

383
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:22,634
Why would I know about this?

384
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:25,674
It's the Tokyo Tower's big rival.
 The mascot of the Skytree.

385
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,839
You should understand that.

386
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,874
Sorakara's catchphrase is

387
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:32,981
"From the sky, from now on, I will try", you know?

388
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,031
Hug, please!!

389
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:41,069
From the sky, from now on, I will try!!

390
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,187
So cute...

391
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:45,257
Huh?

392
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:50,144
- Thank you very much.
- Keep working hard.

393
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:52,214
Thank you.

394
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,251
I hope everyone visits the Skytree soon!

395
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,558
Excuse me!

396
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:04,643
Ah, officer.

397
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:06,678
- Chiyoko-san.
- It's Sayoko.

398
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:08,581
Ah, Sayoko-san.

399
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:11,515
Thank you for yesterday's chat.

400
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:13,585
Chat...

401
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:18,958
Ah, about whether my husband was killed by a curse.

402
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:20,746
Yes... To be exact,

403
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:24,449
killed by 
the souls of the people buried under Tokyo Tower.

404
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,432
Are you being serious?

405
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:29,553
And how is it connected to...

406
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:31,952
the transmissions from the Skytree.

407
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:33,906
Don't worry.

408
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:37,829
We're conducting a regular investigation
alongside this one.

409
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:40,779
I tend to have a unique perspective.

410
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,731
Doesn't that annoy people?
 Like your boss?

411
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,768
That's fine, as long as I solve the crime.

412
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:51,756
It must be tough dealing with your boss.

413
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,842
It is.

414
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,912
By the way, what brings you out here?

415
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,949
I live near here.

416
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:06,754
Before we married, he...

417
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:08,614
my husband,

418
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:10,892
would walk with me

419
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,962
back to my house.

420
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:20,011
The idea of our neighbourhood having such a famous
building, well, we never even thought of it.

421
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,923
The landscape isn't the only thing to change.

422
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,944
People's feelings change, too.

423
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,053
We went to the Skytree.

424
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:40,772
So?

425
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:45,860
Your brother died while 
he was doing a test transmission from the Skytree.

426
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,930
When is the next test transmission?

427
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:53,735
I heard they're doing one every day this week.
 Why do you ask?

428
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,772
- And it's at the same time each night?
- I guess.

429
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,797
Please!

430
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,296
- At the next test is it possible for the two of us 
to be there?
- You want to be there?

431
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,782
So we can watch the test transmission.

432
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,802
Sure.
 I'll tell security to expect you.

433
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,872
Thank you very much!

434
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,779
Ah, are these the trophies you won for 
Scoop of the Year?

435
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:21,679
Gohara was 
telling me how you used to work together.

436
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,615
I owe Officer Gohara a lot.

437
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,250
Amazing!

438
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,970
You win it every year.

439
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,658
All because of my colleagues and contacts.

440
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,777
Thanks to them, I can do my job.

441
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:36,881
The younger brother wins awards every
year and is allowed to make a TV show.

442
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:40,931
The older brother has the job he wants
taken away from him.

443
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,718
You reap what you sow.

444
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,754
He was a womaniser.

445
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:49,827
Everyone knew the rumours.
 It affected his assessments.

446
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:51,877
He was a fool.

447
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:57,015
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

448
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:00,788
Wasn't there something a bit odd about him?

449
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:01,934
Odd?

450
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:03,755
How?

451
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:08,760
He didn't once look at your legs

452
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,879
plus he seems really into his work.

453
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,949
You're wrong, Katsuura.

454
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,753
Hiroyuki-san isn't obsessed by work, but...

455
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,839
he's obsessed by someone else.

456
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:24,909
Obsessed?
 Who?

457
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,126
Well, what shall we do until tonight?

458
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:03,198
Wait...

459
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:08,002
Something's not quite right...

460
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:20,013
Were you still seeing Sugai-san?

461
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,820
As usual, you're so boring.

462
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,893
You're young, can't you dress a bit more stylishly?

463
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:30,975
Huh?

464
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:34,233
Because of that, Sugai-san was getting
tired of you.

465
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,916
That's what he told me.

466
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:42,986
That child wants to get married so much
it's annoying me.

467
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,941
He said the same to me.

468
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,886
He got less work since the alpha-female
announcer got involved.

469
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,814
- What the hell!
- What?

470
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,919
- How dare you!

471
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,887
- Katsuura!
Stop them!
- Yes!

472
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:02,857
Excuse me.
Could you stop, please.

473
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,859
Stop...

474
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,962
Stop, please...

475
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,907
- What the...?
Shibayama. Split them up.
- Sir!

476
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:13,951
Police! Break it up!

477
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:16,021
I told you to stop!

478
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,858
Otonashi, what are you doing back here?

479
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:24,982
Since that meeting with the slit-mouthed woman
I've lost all courage.

480
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:27,032
- You cretin.
- That was close...

481
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,869
There's no need to cry.

482
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:36,928
We just want to know what you did during that day.

483
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,063
I was at home all evening.

484
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:45,017
Can you prove it?

485
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,872
I live alone!
Of course I can't!

486
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,940
I see...

487
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,010
Ah, this is a pain.

488
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:58,833
I'm sorry you had to see all that.

489
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,848
Hm?

490
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:04,952
To see a young girl and her rival in love fighting.

491
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:07,022
It's undignified at my age.

492
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,828
I don't think age has anything to do with it.

493
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:12,860
Huh?

494
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,912
The way I dress

495
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:18,982
Whether I'm thirty or forty, I think
I'll still dress the same.

496
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:25,022
- You want to grow old and stay cool.
- Well...

497
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:29,914
Even if the age difference is large,
people can still be in love.

498
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,964
That's what I think is cool.

499
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,853
Not that we're saying it's good to have an affair.

500
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:39,954
You don't get it, Katsuura.
I wasn't talking about that.

501
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,024
I'm talking about self-awareness.
 Kaori-san.

502
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:47,945
That's why I'm always making the same mistakes.

503
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:52,015
Same places and faces every day.

504
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:57,004
But the next person you meet might
make it worth while.

505
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,826
Maybe.

506
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,913
It's been a while since I wore a mini-skirt.

507
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,865
It has its pros and cons.

508
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:11,969
- Let's go, Katsuura.
- Okay.

509
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:14,102
- Thank you very much
- Excuse us.

510
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:19,860
- He's back.
- Tannai-san.

511
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,862
Mm?

512
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:23,918
It's about the victim's wife, Sayoko-san.

513
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,903
- And...?
- On that night, after nine o'clock

514
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,872
she was seen arguing in the hallway

515
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,922
- with the victim.
- Quarrel?

516
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,242
They were seen by a member of staff.

517
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,962
Why are you being like this?

518
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:41,032
Don't you understand?

519
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,801
I can't take any more!

520
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:47,855
The wife has been trying to get a
divorce for a long time

521
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,890
but he refuses to agree.

522
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,859
Despite all his affairs.

523
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,778
Exactly.

524
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:55,913
It must've driven her mad.

525
00:33:55,983 --> 00:34:00,983
A wife with a husband who refuses a divorce.

526
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:08,977
Quarrelled with his wife?

527
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:14,064
I wonder why Suichi-san wouldn't agreed
to get divorced.

528
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,951
Thanks for your hard work.

529
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,021
- Ah, the pest.
- The last face I wanted to see.

530
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:23,858
Hey, what are you doing now.

531
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,881
The nail on the little finger of the
left hand grows fastest.

532
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,900
I haven't grown mine long, so
if I draw a red heart on it

533
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,889
and then cut it off when it's grown long
then that will make me lucky in love.

534
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,891
- What? You mean?
- With Katsuura?

535
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,839
- No way!
 As if...

536
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,944
My perfect man would definitely be
an expert in urban myths.

537
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:45,963
Is that all?

538
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:49,033
It'd be a start.
See you.

539
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:55,973
So she's not after Katsuura?

540
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:58,356
maybe she's not as bad as we thought.

541
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:02,113
Young women as so simple these days.

542
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,854
Our radio experiment!

543
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:15,009
If we sit in the same place as Sugai-san at
the same time, what do you think will happen?

544
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,549
Well, perhaps...

545
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,080
We might die?

546
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,952
Which way?

547
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,022
Hm, which way was it?

548
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,857
You don't remember?

549
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,859
I didn't come this way.

550
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,848
When I was here with Forensics,
we took the elevator.

551
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,913
Plus, it wasn't as dark.

552
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:37,983
Maybe this way?

553
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,954
You're right.
It'll be this way.

554
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:51,862
Now I think of it, TV studios are
designed to be confusing.

555
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:56,436
In the event of terrorists attacking they'll
 find it difficult to occupy the building.

556
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:58,986
Really?
Is that right?

557
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:05,880
It was in this neighbourhood that
the 47 Ronin committed suicide.

558
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,862
I don't need to know that.

559
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,851
And there's a rumour of the ghost
of an actress who killed herself.

560
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:12,900
Please, no more stories.

561
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,023
You can hear her voice calling from the studio.

562
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,026
Ah! It's her!

563
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:24,812
No, that's... huh?!

564
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,918
You're Kimura Kaela, aren't you!!!

565
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,840
Amazing!
 It's really you!
Can I shake your hand?

566
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,839
- Okay.
- So cute!

567
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:37,878
- Katsuura, you shake her hand, too!
- Is that okay?

568
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,877
- Wow, thank you.

569
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,847
- Thank you very much.
- No, thank you.

570
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,949
Well, I'll be off.

571
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:47,019
Bye bye.

572
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,938
"Mamillel", "Mamillel"...

573
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,008
Oh, sorry.

574
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,861
Why didn't we ask her the way to the studio?

575
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:59,016
Sorry, I got carried away.

576
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,216
Ah, we'll be fine.

577
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:05,820
- Ah! Look out!
- Katsuura, what's wrong?

578
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,875
I saw the lights on the Tokyo Tower go on.

579
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,841
Oh, that?
 Don't worry.

580
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:13,861
While inspection work is going on,

581
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,881
the lights will be on until midnight.

582
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:19,887
Before the urban myth about the
lights was well-known.

583
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:25,876
On days when they had inspections, when it turned
midnight, that was when they turned off the lights.

584
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:29,844
So that was just the inspection work beginning?

585
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,812
- Yes.
- Thank goodness.

586
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,848
So Tokyo Tower isn't angry.

587
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,966
Of course not.

588
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:38,411
If Tokyo Tower was angry the lights...

589
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,939
Hm?

590
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,009
Tilted?

591
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,877
An urban myth!
It's here!

592
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,883
A bit of an over-reaction, Tsukiko-san.

593
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,831
Or maybe it's not.

594
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,850
But it looks a bit slanted...

595
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,871
Huh? Leaning...?

596
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,956
Look, isn't it at an angle?

597
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,276
- Definitely not straight.
- Lean...?

598
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,861
Ah!

599
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,934
Katsuura, where are you going?
Katsuura!

600
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:09,536
Wait!

601
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,945
What's up?

602
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:24,015
I knew it.

603
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,522
- It's her!
- It's her!!

604
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:59,366
What are you two doing here?

605
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:01,418
Oh.

606
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:06,488
- Us? Investigating, right?
- Investigating.

607
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:35,587
What's this?

608
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:41,523
Fools.
Men and women.

609
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,590
Sorry for being late.

610
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,526
You wanted to talk?

611
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:03,614
About my brother.

612
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:10,320
I wonder how many women saw the lights
go out with him from here.

613
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,373
Who knows.

614
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:16,379
I've never seen the lights go out with someone.

615
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:20,450
Me neither.
 Not even once.

616
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:34,463
Huh?

617
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,033
They won't be going out tonight.

618
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:42,538
Just for tonight they're doing special maintenence

619
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:45,223
so the lights will be on after midnight.

620
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,147
tonight they're doing special maintenence

621
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,697
so the lights will be on after midnight.

622
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,748
Tannai-san.
Shibayama-san.

623
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:58,818
You don't need to follow the wife any more.

624
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:05,474
What are you doing?
Disrupting police work.

625
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:12,865
Last night, at midnight at the TV studio,
we got lost

626
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:16,869
but I was able to see, just for a moment,

627
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,505
the Tower leaning over.

628
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:21,341
Not really.
The tower wasn't titled.

629
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:26,611
Instead it was another piece of evidence
that was leaning.

630
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:31,222
The trophy for your 2009 award
is in the staff room.

631
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:36,872
But when compared to the other four,
it is tilted forward.

632
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:38,523
This differance...

633
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,293
bothered me.

634
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:44,413
But that evening,

635
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:47,569
Hiroyuki-san and the announcer Tsumura
were in the staff room.

636
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,619
But that's not true either.

637
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:55,541
Tsumura-san was really here,

638
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,611
meeting Sugai-san.

639
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:10,475
I'll change my ways, so let's try again.

640
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:30,429
Funny that it was here... 
where you saw it all, Kaori-san.

641
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:32,544
Thirty minutes after this...

642
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:35,614
She hadn't returned to the staff room

643
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,535
Hiroyuki-san.

644
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:45,605
I've seen the video that you cherished so much.

645
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:49,596
This is...

646
00:42:53,535 --> 00:42:55,534
"Congratulations"
"Thank you"

647
00:42:55,604 --> 00:42:57,979
"Thank you very much"
"Congratulations"

648
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,609
"Congratulations"
"I wish you all the best"

649
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,613
"Thank you very much"

650
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:10,132
"Hiroyuki-san, did you eat lunch today?"

651
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,619
It was a video of only Sayoko-san.

652
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,556
From a long time ago

653
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:20,626
you've only had eyes for her.

654
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:23,512
Hiroyuki-san?

655
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:25,582
But your brother...

656
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,019
I'll change my ways, so let's try again.

657
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:46,617
Wait, brother.
 I said wait!

658
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:52,407
What are you doing?!

659
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:55,464
If you don't have feelings for your wife,
then let her get a divorce.

660
00:43:55,514 --> 00:43:58,533
Sayoko-san told me.
That you're stopping the divorce going through.

661
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,502
- I won't get a divorce.
- Why not?

662
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:02,401
So you can't have her.

663
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:04,419
What?

664
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:06,588
Why do you think I'm stopping it?

665
00:44:06,658 --> 00:44:09,658
I know it all.
You've loved Sayoko for years.

666
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:14,429
Does she know how you feel?

667
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:16,501
Why don't I call her now and tell her?

668
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:18,517
Stop!

669
00:44:18,587 --> 00:44:22,173
While I was seeing other women,
you wanted your sister-in-law.

670
00:44:22,223 --> 00:44:24,573
Let's have Sayoko-san decide...

671
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:27,643
which one of us is the worst.

672
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,438
You hit your brother with all your might.

673
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:43,575
The impact damaged the trophy

674
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:46,645
and you were still angry at your brother.

675
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:51,450
He didn't really notice the scratch marks.

676
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,604
Suichi-san just went to do his job

677
00:44:55,674 --> 00:44:59,674
There in the control room

678
00:45:05,617 --> 00:45:11,617
he died of a brain contusion caused by the blow.

679
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:15,409
We examined the trophy earlier and

680
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,229
we found traces of your brother's blood.

681
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,256
One day, I wanted

682
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:33,451
to see the lights go out with you.

683
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:40,283
You're crazy.

684
00:45:41,286 --> 00:45:45,877
How many times did your brother
see the lights go out and...

685
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:49,339
not once did he find eternal love.

686
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:58,167
Magic won't work for people with
evil in their heart.

687
00:45:58,237 --> 00:46:01,253
So you have to atone for your sins

688
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:05,323
before you see the lights, don't you think?

689
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:17,302
Sugai-san, let's go.

690
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:37,322
What?
It was Sugai-san?

691
00:46:39,194 --> 00:46:41,226
And he was such a nice guy.

692
00:46:41,296 --> 00:46:46,296
It's not just bad people who commit murders.

693
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:15,660
Tannai-san, your wife will come back.
I'm sure of it.

694
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,630
Well, of course she will!

695
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,820
Today's been a bad day.

696
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:31,343
It really is pretty, isn't it.

697
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,147
Tomorrow we should go up the Tokyo Tower.

698
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:39,268
Hmm, but I want to go to the top of the Skytree.

699
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:43,338
- What are you talking about? Let's go.
- Okay.

700
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,239
When did it go out? Just now?

701
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:02,309
I wasn't looking...

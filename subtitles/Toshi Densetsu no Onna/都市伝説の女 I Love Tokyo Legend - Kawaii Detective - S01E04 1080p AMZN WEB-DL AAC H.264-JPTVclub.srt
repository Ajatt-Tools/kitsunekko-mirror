1
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:16,953
Father.

2
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,876
Father...

3
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:27,246
(wind)

4
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,645
Mount Takao.
 I've never been here before.

5
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:44,948
You mentioned a three-star restaurant.

6
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,920
Shall we check if we can make a reservation?

7
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,923
- The three-star attraction is Mount Takao itself.
- Hm? The mountain?

8
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:53,890
It offers beautiful scenery,
easy to reach from the city centre

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,960
and it's great for hikers and climbers.

10
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,901
- So the Michelin guide gave it three-stars.
- A three-star mountain.

11
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:04,851
If you're not interested, 
you didn't have to come with me.

12
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,138
That's to say, we're both off-duty today.

13
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,561
That's why I'm here. 
Now we can forget work and enjoy our date -

14
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,694
Date?

15
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:18,084
If you're here with that attitude it's
probably best if we don't go up together.

16
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:20,183
What do you mean?

17
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:24,253
This mountain is a special place.

18
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,093
This is the home of the Tengu.

19
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:34,247
- The Tengu doesn't -
- Shh! Be quiet!

20
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:37,317
Tsukiko-san?

21
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:40,254
This is the men's slope!

22
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:49,245
Tsukiko-san! 
The other way's easier!

23
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:53,266
Tsukiko-san!
Boy, can she ever run.

24
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:04,094
- Ah, it's not here.
- What?

25
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:08,081
This tree is called the seat of the Tengu

26
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:13,086
Sometimes you can see the Tengu sitting
on the lower branch of the tree.

27
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,325
Okay, next!

28
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:21,275
Please help me understand more...

29
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:26,316
This is the Large Tengu.

30
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:30,186
Hm.

31
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,256
This is the Small Tengu.

32
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:38,178
- He's called the Crow Tengu.
- Hmm.

33
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:41,248
And these are the Tengu's sandals.

34
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,040
- You know a lot about the Tengu...
- The Crow Tengu is thought of as a mountain god,

35
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,094
and the other kind of Tengu were monks
who died during their strict training

36
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:54,164
and came back after death as supernatural beings.

37
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:57,214
People becoming Tengu?
Are you sure about that?

38
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:05,222
Tsukiko-san?

39
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:19,055
And at Mount Takao, 
you can still hear the voice of the Tengu... 
here!

40
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,055
Where is here, exactly?

41
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,549
I thought I told you?

42
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,666
- That time when I was spirited away.
- Yes.

43
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:29,511
Back then, my home wasn't far from here.

44
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:33,119
What? 
Near here?
Perhaps I should meet your parents?

45
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,086
- Shh. The voice.
- Voice?

46
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:40,460
Tsukiko-san! 
What's with all this running?

47
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:53,452
Tsukiko-san! 
Wait!

48
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:04,317
Tsukiko-san!
 Tsukiko-san!

49
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:29,842
That's...

50
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,382
He's dead.

51
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,452
I'll call the police.

52
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:04,974
What's your name?

53
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:07,443
I don't know.

54
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,648
You don't remember?

55
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,558
- Just press this.
- I know, I know.

56
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,490
Jeez, you're annoying...

57
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,476
Ah you just deleted it!

58
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,479
All that work, gone, thanks to you

59
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:44,948
- Aaaaagh!!

60
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:47,120
How can I be expected to do my job with that thing?

61
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,069
I agree!

62
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,159
This is no substitute for an intuition
as finely-tuned as yours.

63
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:56,522
That finely-tuned intuition needs adjusting, frankly.

64
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,048
"It was an autumn evening..."

65
00:06:02,118 --> 00:06:05,121
Reading "The Pillow Book" won't make you look smart.

66
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:09,022
She said if I borrow this book from the library

67
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,110
I'll meet someone important in my life.

68
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,111
So Otonashi has got to you, has she?

69
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:18,181
I also want to get married. 
At least once.

70
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:21,084
Married?
 You?

71
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:23,102
If I can't do it, you can't!

72
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:26,072
Of course, Tannai-san is a divorcee.

73
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,124
Idiot! Wrong!

74
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:32,095
I'm not divorced and I'm not going to get divorced.

75
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:36,149
It's just that my wife took our child
for a short...

76
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:39,219
for a long break at her parents.

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,145
(phone)

78
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:49,178
Hello?
 What's that? 
You've found a body?!

79
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,170
- Katsuura.
- Yes.

80
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,127
- Could you take more photos round there?
- Yep. When I've done this.

81
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:03,192
- Okay.

82
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:07,262
- And yours too!
- Again?

83
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:13,056
Good work, guys.
 What do we know about the victim?

84
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:16,142
The time of death was around five o'clock
this morning.

85
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:20,093
It looks like suicide, but we'll run an
autopsy to be sure.

86
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,095
You think it might be murder?

87
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:25,165
There are signs of a struggle, and also a wound.

88
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:30,234
She's the one who made the first examination.

89
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:34,110
Otonashi! 
What were you doing here?

90
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,092
Ah, I'm glad you're here.

91
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:41,184
- The report said something about a child?
- Yes, but he seems to have lost his memory.

92
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:44,017
- Amnesia?
- He doesn't remember a thing.

93
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,085
Nothing at all?

94
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:49,088
From the evidence here, this case definitely

95
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:52,141
- involves an urban legend.
- Aaaaagh!

96
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:55,094
Enough already.
 Shibayama, you take over.

97
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:58,201
You know, Otonashi, 
I was in a mountaineering club, so-

98
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:01,251
- No doubt about it.

99
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:07,222
That child... saw a Tengu!

100
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:15,151
subs: ersby

101
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:25,272
raws: furransu

102
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:47,148
Neither the monks nor this child

103
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:50,216
are able to tell us the victim's identity.

104
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:53,186
It's a tricky situation.

105
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:57,256
By the way, should we take this kid to a hospital?

106
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:00,277
Ah!

107
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,082
- Oh!
- Didn't we meet before?
 At Masakado's shrine?

108
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:10,103
- Why are you here?
- I come here to gain strength.

109
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:14,190
Strength? 
Is this place like a power spot, you mean?

110
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,093
Yes. In this area

111
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:21,080
this village is famous for being a somewhat unique.

112
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,168
Those with a strong spirit can take great
power here

113
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:29,038
but for those with a weak spirit, it's a
little dangerous.

114
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:35,094
Well, those are the two contrasting sides
of this village.

115
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:42,104
Also, when people disappear,
 their families often come here to pray for help.

116
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:43,224
That's right.

117
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:48,808
The photos of the missing people
that the families leave are...

118
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,194
collected by that shop

119
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,264
so I believe.

120
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,119
Excuse me! 
Do you keep the photos of all the missing people?

121
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:00,089
- Of course she doesn't.
- He's right. 
It's not true.

122
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,089
There would be too many.

123
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,091
I only have these few.

124
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,994
- What? 
You have them?
- I knew it!

125
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,216
They leave them so anyone who's seen the people

126
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:14,266
can call the number and let the families know.

127
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:20,173
It's heeeere!!

128
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:24,243
Tannai-san, look. 
This is the man who died.

129
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:29,182
- Shibayama. 
Contact the station.
- Sir!

130
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:32,252
Thank you very much.
If it weren't for you...

131
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:37,272
- Where's he gone?
- He was right here.

132
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:46,082
You're the police?

133
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,087
Officer Tannai, Investigation Division.

134
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:50,119
Ah. Hello.

135
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:53,089
Kunieda Teruo. 
We spoke on the phone.

136
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,109
Okubo is my friend and colleague.
Or rather... he was.

137
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,145
This photo is him?

138
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:05,084
Yes. He disappeared three months ago.
We had no idea where he went.

139
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:09,055
Okubo-san was a teacher, is that right?

140
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,141
Yes. We worked at the same school.

141
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:15,027
By the way

142
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:18,097
is it true that his child has lost his memory?

143
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,100
We think it's due to shock.

144
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,135
I see.

145
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:27,006
And physically? 
Was he injured?

146
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,091
No, he wasn't.

147
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:33,112
He'll be kept for two or three days
for observation.

148
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:39,171
Shock can do that. Imagine what it's
like to see your own father's suicide.

149
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:42,034
We haven't established that it's suicide yet.

150
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:48,060
- Jun? Where is he?
- Who are you?

151
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,116
I'm his mother.
Please let me see him.

152
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:54,100
If it were up to me, then you could,
but at the moment...

153
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,057
I haven't seen him since yesterday,
I've been looking all this time.

154
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,072
I was so worried

155
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:02,208
Let me see him!

156
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,278
Chiaki-san.
 Calm down.

157
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,247
Is it true he killed himself in front of my child?

158
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:16,022
Why did he take Jun, so he could commit suicide?

159
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:20,126
- He was a terrible father, right to the end.
- Don't say that.

160
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:23,095
I think it was because he was lonely.

161
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:27,083
First was the divorce, then he lost
contact with his son.

162
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:29,101
But that was for Jun's benefit.

163
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:34,073
But Jun told me that he wanted his
dad to come back.

164
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,075
He was so sad.

165
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:40,129
What would you know?
What does anyone know?

166
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:42,064
Calm down! 
Please calm down!

167
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:45,084
Sorry. 
I said too much.

168
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:48,154
But, could you let him rest for now?

169
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:51,224
For Jun's sake.
 Please!

170
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:03,249
It's okay. 
He's not injured and
 I think the amnesia is only temporary.

171
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:16,182
So the parents are divorced.

172
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:21,252
Yes. Chiaki and her son moved out

173
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:39,071
Ah, you finally showed up.
You brought Forensics with you?

174
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:42,094
Today's my day off.
 I was on a date with Tsukiko-san.

175
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:45,094
- A date?
- I already told you it wasn't a date.

176
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:47,029
- Remember?
- Sorry.

177
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:51,083
- You went climbing together...?
- Gohara-san, how can I help?

178
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:54,106
The Okubo case. 
I heard it's suicide, right?

179
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:56,005
Sorry, but that's our case.

180
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:58,090
No way. 
It's our case.

181
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,109
- What do you mean?
- Okubo-san

182
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,112
- is a suspect in a murder case.
- A suspect?

183
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,181
It happened three years ago.

184
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:08,251
That case about the high school student?

185
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,093
The victim was called Sasaki Kozue.

186
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:20,112
At the time Okubo was a student teacher

187
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:24,033
She was found strangled to death in a Love Hotel.

188
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:29,105
Surveillance cameras showed her and a man
entering the hotel together

189
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:33,092
but the man's face was obscured by the
hat he was wearing.

190
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,045
Why was Okubo a suspect?

191
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,217
When we looked at the victim's mobile phone

192
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:41,580
we found a lot of incoming calls
from the same number.

193
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:47,159
Okubo had been repeatedly calling her.

194
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,764
Just a few days before the incident...

195
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:01,103
they were seen arguing near the Love Hotel

196
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:05,074
but without any conclusive evidence
we couldn't charge him

197
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:08,043
but even now I'm sure he did it.

198
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:12,148
- He killed himself because of the guilt?
- Makes sense.

199
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:15,070
He killed himself, even though his son was there?

200
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,069
A terrible father, indeed.

201
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,089
Was he trying to cleanse his soul

202
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,224
- by atoning for his sins?
- No.

203
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:24,294
You're wrong.

204
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:31,150
I've got it.
 I know why Okubo-san committed suicide.

205
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,086
- Tsukiko-san?
- A murderer

206
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:39,058
approached Mount Takao with such a great sin

207
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,160
that it provoked anger.

208
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,163
- Anger?
 What anger?
- Don't listen to her.

209
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,233
The Tengu!

210
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:50,035
The Tengu was called down from the mountain.

211
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:54,126
There's an old legend about the Tengu
killing any bandits on the mountain.

212
00:15:54,176 --> 00:16:00,099
Since Okubo had not atoned for his crime when
 he went to the mountain with his son, then...

213
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,082
Otonashi, you're not making any sense.

214
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,184
I see. 
Wow. 
This is it.

215
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,254
Ah, I'm just popping out.

216
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:13,095
- Is it safe to let her out by herself?
- I'm past caring.

217
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:16,078
So if you don't mind, I'm taking this case.

218
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,113
Okay. 
It's all yours.

219
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:20,065
- Move out!
- Sir!

220
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:23,035
- You're dropping the case?
- Of course not.

221
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:29,058
If we want to solve the case of Okubo we have
to investigate the events of three years ago.

222
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:33,078
Gohara-san couldn't solve it, do you
think we'll be able to?

223
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:35,086
- That's right! 
Let's go!
- Sir!

224
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,170
Iwata, if anyone asks, 
I haven't gone out to work on this case.

225
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
I'm going too.

226
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:51,196
Jun. It's me. 
Your mother.

227
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:53,266
You know me, right?

228
00:16:56,255 --> 00:17:01,255
You really don't?

229
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:09,246
Sorry, ma'am.

230
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,214
Chiaki-san.

231
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:34,006
You should've told them you're
still in touch with Okubo-san.

232
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:37,096
You don't what it's like being the wife
of a murder suspect.

233
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:39,148
But I told them, and they know I'm innocent.

234
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:42,097
Oh, well, good for you!

235
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,117
It's because we're a couple.

236
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:49,187
Okubo killed that girl.

237
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,301
Now I see!

238
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:55,077
I don't know much about couples but
 I understand women better.

239
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:57,099
And I thought: there's something
she's not telling us.

240
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:02,101
Of all the students he had relations with,
he killed her at the hotel.

241
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:05,087
And you couldn't forgive him.

242
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,090
You police think you're so clever.

243
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,143
So he killed that girl in cold blood.

244
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:14,199
It doesn't matter what you say if your
the family of the murderer.

245
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,249
Excuse me.

246
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:28,110
Don't worry about her. 
She's a little touchy.

247
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,080
They're not actually divorced.

248
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,084
That's right. 
Okubo-san was against it.

249
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:40,089
As soon as Chiaki filed for mediation,
that's when he disappeared.

250
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,092
Well, she said she hated Okubo

251
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:45,247
but I'm not so sure.

252
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:06,249
You're not eating?

253
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:10,085
- I'm not hungry.
- Hmm.

254
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:14,089
You know, everyone has a secret.

255
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,044
My secret is that I've also met the Tengu.

256
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,064
What's a tengu?

257
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,422
Oh yeah.

258
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:28,087
You don't remember anything about this morning.

259
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:30,205
Sorry.

260
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:34,275
That's okay.
I'm sure you'll remember soon.

261
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:37,079
Really.

262
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:42,067
I also lost my memory. 
Even who my family were.
 Everything.

263
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:46,054
You forgot things too?

264
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,074
At first, but I remembered after a while.

265
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:52,177
So everything will be fine.

266
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,247
Really?

267
00:19:55,267 --> 00:20:01,267
I'm a police officer, so you can
trust me. Everything will be fine.

268
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:07,226
So try a little. 
That hamburger looks good.

269
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:11,029
How is it? 
Good?

270
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,098
- Can I try some?
- Nope.

271
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,067
Just a mouthful.

272
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:17,202
It looks tasty, though.

273
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:20,272
I'm a bit hungry, so...

274
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,059
I'm impressed.

275
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:28,113
That child doesn't usually like strangers.

276
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:31,099
He and I share the same secret.

277
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,085
Hm?

278
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:37,172
Of course, Jun can't remember now

279
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:40,242
- What secret?
- I can't say.

280
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:45,083
When I meet police officers as
good at their job as you

281
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,103
- I always get nervous.
- Why? Have you done something bad?

282
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:51,153
On the way here, I went through a red light.

283
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:53,172
That is bad!

284
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:56,242
Lucky I'm not a traffic cop, huh?

285
00:20:57,162 --> 00:21:01,029
You and Jun are pretty close?

286
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,103
Yes. 
After Chiaki-san moved out, 
Okubo asked me how they were doing

287
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:08,120
and to make sure they were okay.

288
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,992
Ever since that event three years ago,
Chiaki-san became much more tense.

289
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,062
She had a hard time of it then.

290
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,851
(ringtone)

291
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:43,703
Katsuura, what is it?

292
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:46,676
- "We got the results from the autopsy."
- What did it say?

293
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:49,742
There's a good chance that it's murder.

294
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:53,696
They found pressure marks in several places
made by fingers.

295
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,669
Maybe he was pushed down before being
hung from the rope.

296
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:59,752
"Someone's fingers? 
Are they sure?"

297
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:01,807
Yes.
 I have the coroner's report.

298
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:05,808
"Katsuura. 
Be at my place in an hour."

299
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,003
I was hoping you'd say that. 
Okay.

300
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:14,835
Huh?

301
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,674
- Katsuura!
- Fancy meeting you here!

302
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:25,728
- Do you know this man?
- We meet from time to time.

303
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:28,731
- About this morning.
- Yes?

304
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:33,719
- Did you find the Tengu?
- Huh?

305
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:39,659
It seems not. 
I suppose it's too much to ask.

306
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:44,730
- Even I have only ever heard its voice.
- Voice?

307
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,684
I heard it laughing loudly once.

308
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:52,705
Like it was laughing at our world without soul.

309
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:56,676
So you also believe in the Tengu?

310
00:22:56,746 --> 00:23:01,731
What?
You don't?

311
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:04,600
Well, normally... 
I suppose not.

312
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,803
I see.

313
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:13,873
Katsuura doesn't trust Tsukiko-san...

314
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:18,881
Huh? When did I tell him my name?

315
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,717
Who is that guy?

316
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:24,704
Huh? You don't know him?

317
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:26,806
Well, I don't know his name.

318
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:29,876
Come to think of it, nor do we.

319
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,806
Wait! I'm getting on!

320
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:45,876
Hold the bus!

321
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:57,723
Wait a second!

322
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:22,411
Running in heels really tires you out.

323
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:26,498
Then you should wear sensible shoes.
You're on duty, after all.

324
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:30,568
My boss says the same thing.

325
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:35,427
But if I did what he said, I'd feel
like I was losing.

326
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:39,394
- You like showing off your legs that much?
- Yes.

327
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:42,085
No other police office has these and

328
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:46,549
they're pretty useful when dealing
with colleagues or criminals,

329
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,420
who are usually men.

330
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,505
It's tiring, though.

331
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:53,575
I don't suppose you know how to give a massage?

332
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:59,498
- Sorry.
- Hm?

333
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:04,006
I may have said to much earlier.
After all, you're just doing your job.

334
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:10,508
We think that Okubo-san may have been murdered.

335
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:13,445
What?

336
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,414
It's just as you said.

337
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:22,524
Investigating the truth can reopen old wounds and
you have to listen to things you don't want to hear.

338
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:24,574
My apologies.

339
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:30,512
So? 
What did you want to ask that made you run like that?

340
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:33,582
It was about a wife's intuition.

341
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:37,402
Was Okubo-san really a killer?

342
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:39,504
This is important.

343
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:43,574
Why do you believe he did it?

344
00:25:46,565 --> 00:25:50,565
Every evening he'd make the secret phone calls.

345
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:53,285
That's why...
 Wait! Kozue!

346
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:55,355
Don't hang up!

347
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:58,341
(footsteps)

348
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:03,195
Ah, sorry.
 Did I wake you up?

349
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:06,164
- Who was that?
- Just a student.

350
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:09,234
At this time?
What did they want?

351
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:13,255
Nothing really. 
Go back to bed.

352
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:18,325
I knew what he was doing... 
calling that student.

353
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:24,199
Having an affair with a student
and then killing her

354
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:28,236
How do you think that made us
look to everyone else?

355
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:31,156
But he was against you getting a divorce.

356
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:35,177
"At this time, family is all I have,"
 he said.

357
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:38,263
Did he hold a grudge?
What do you think?!

358
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,333
He couldn't leave us in peace.

359
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:50,045
Is Okubo-san really the criminal...?

360
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,114
This is delicious.

361
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:55,201
Katsuura-san, won't you eat with us?

362
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,271
Yep. 
Just finishing off here.

363
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:04,176
Ah, I messed up!

364
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,246
That's no good.

365
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:11,183
Stop fussing.

366
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:14,253
I'm not fussing.
 I just want to get it right.

367
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:18,190
Good!

368
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Okay, let's eat.

369
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,081
I have to go now.

370
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:29,118
- You're leaving?
- For my part-time job.

371
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,120
Thanks for the meal.

372
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,089
Oh, well. 
Such a shame!
A real pity.

373
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,145
Well, you don't want to be late.

374
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,727
- Work hard.
 Bye.
- Bye.

375
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:41,297
Stay out as long as you want.

376
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:48,237
Just the two of us...

377
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,097
The coroner's report talked about finger marks. 
But...

378
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,294
what does that mean?

379
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:59,114
This post mortem suggests

380
00:27:59,184 --> 00:28:02,059
that my theory about the Tengu might be wrong.

381
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:05,120
Unless those were marks left by the Tengu.

382
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,122
Well, who knows?

383
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:10,092
I spoke to his wife

384
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:13,078
and she was convinced he was a murderer.

385
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:17,166
Is that what brought on the anger of the Tengu?

386
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:19,154
Are we talking about the same Tengu?

387
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:22,037
A nose like this, and wings.

388
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:25,077
Everyone knows this description,
but it could be wrong.

389
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:29,128
Whatever form it takes, these mountain
gods have a strange power.

390
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:31,180
Seriously?

391
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,250
I thought that whole thing about being
spirited away was a joke.

392
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:40,089
What? A joke?!

393
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,124
- What do you mean?
- Ah.

394
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:47,380
I trusted you by 
telling you one of my closest secrets.

395
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,836
And you think I'm joking.
 I see.
Now I know what you think of me.

396
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:52,818
Well, no...

397
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:55,808
- Well, then. 
Good night.
- No, you've got it all wrong.

398
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:57,810
I don't want to talk to you again.
 Get out.

399
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,759
No, it's not like that!

400
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,963
- The conversation's over.
- Wait, I didn't mean... 
- Have a nice life!

401
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,168
I believe you -

402
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,920
I finally got her alone...

403
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:14,141
Damned Tengu.

404
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:18,978
Security? For Jun?

405
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:25,971
Now this has become a murder case and Jun has seen
the criminal's face we believe he may be in danger.

406
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:29,021
We'll take shifts in guarding his room.

407
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:31,091
I see.

408
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:35,177
Whatever it takes to protect him, I suppose.

409
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,121
I told you to bring me the reports about
that case from three years ago.

410
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:45,207
But you're so slow that even Tannai-san has
got ahead of us!

411
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:47,176
- Sorry.
- Good morning, Gohara-san.

412
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:49,141
- Ah, Tsukiko. Good morning.

413
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,144
Why didn't you arrest Okubo-san

414
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:54,129
three years ago?

415
00:29:54,199 --> 00:30:00,239
There was only circumstantial evidence but it
doesn't seem like you to drop a case because of that.

416
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:02,289
Was there something else?

417
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:06,161
It's okay. 
I won't tell Tannai-san and his team.

418
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:09,164
Well, in that case. 
There were some rumours about the victim.

419
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:11,146
Rumours?!

420
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:13,285
She was earning money doing compensated dating.

421
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:17,335
So the killer may have been someone else.

422
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:21,082
- But this is just between us two.
- I promise.

423
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,258
Really promise?

424
00:30:23,328 --> 00:30:26,328
- Cut that out!
- Ow! Sorry!

425
00:30:31,186 --> 00:30:33,118
Tsukiko-san.

426
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:36,171
I am so sorry about last night.

427
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:39,141
I was up all night studying about the Tengu.

428
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:41,260
Katsuura, follow me.

429
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,330
Huh?

430
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,085
So, these are the classmates of the victim.

431
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,121
I want to speak to the one who was closest to her.

432
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:51,173
So I'll have to speak to all of them.

433
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:53,188
Her best friend...

434
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:55,144
- would be her.
- How do you know?

435
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:58,127
In those photos that Gohara brought in,

436
00:30:58,197 --> 00:31:01,246
she was the only one who was in all nine.

437
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:04,316
- Really?
- Definitely.

438
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,270
That's my boy, Katsuura!

439
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:15,311
How's college? 
Fun?

440
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:21,316
Well... why are you investigating
this case again?

441
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:26,287
Okubo Mitsuhiro-san died recently.

442
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:30,309
Okubo-sensei?

443
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:36,313
There's a chance he was murdered, so
 this case has been reopened too.

444
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,221
Sensei... I can't...

445
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:47,291
Were you close with Sasaki Kozue?

446
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:50,162
We were best friends.

447
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:52,231
Right.

448
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,301
Why are you crying?

449
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:59,254
Okubo-sensei killed Kozue-san.

450
00:31:59,324 --> 00:32:02,324
That's not true!
He never killed anyone!

451
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:05,227
It's not true.

452
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:08,297
He was a good teacher.

453
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:13,302
Is there something you want to tell us?

454
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:20,276
For example, about the compensated dating?

455
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:25,297
This is important.
Please tell me.

456
00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:34,272
We were stupid, Kozue and me.

457
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:39,211
Only Okubo-sensei knew.

458
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:44,281
When he realised what we were doing
he started to worry.

459
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:50,122
You have to stop now.
This is terrible.

460
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:52,157
I won't tell the school

461
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:56,228
nor your parents, or anyone. I promise.

462
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:59,298
So please, stop doing this.

463
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:03,118
He'd call us every evening

464
00:33:03,188 --> 00:33:08,290
to make sure we'd got home safely, and
had eaten properly.

465
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Okubo-san?

466
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:16,181
And when Kozue was killed and he became a suspect

467
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:20,135
he kept his promise to us.

468
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:25,274
And he never told anyone.

469
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:28,344
In fact...

470
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:33,168
If people know you've done compensated dating, 
getting into college will be hard.

471
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:36,201
So I promise I won't even tell the police.

472
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:38,136
But, sensei...

473
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:42,124
It'll be fine.
Because I'm innocent.

474
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:45,227
Now we just have to worry about

475
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:47,297
protecting your future.

476
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:55,103
What a great teacher.

477
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:58,140
I met him last month.

478
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,160
He said he'd stopped work

479
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,147
and was looking for the real killer.

480
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:08,150
He said I could help him prove his innocence.

481
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,321
I gave him all the messages sent from me and Kozue.

482
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,454
He thought there may be a clue in there somewhere

483
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:20,445
which would tell him who the murderer is.

484
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:25,233
But perhaps,

485
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:28,303
that's why he sensei was killed.

486
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:35,230
Because of a clue that I gave him.

487
00:34:45,273 --> 00:34:49,273
For Kozue's sake, you have to be strong.

488
00:34:58,236 --> 00:35:00,236
Here. Use this.

489
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:15,301
Why are we back at Mt Takao?

490
00:35:17,272 --> 00:35:19,121
To apologise.

491
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:22,140
Because I made a terrible mistake.

492
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,159
Eh?

493
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:28,230
This case had nothing to do with the
anger of the Tengu.

494
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
- Well, I guess...
- Quite the opposite.

495
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,187
Okubo-san wasn't a bad man.

496
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:39,224
Rather, he put himself at risk to protect others.

497
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:41,544
A Tengu would never kill such a man.

498
00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:44,597
Okay, let's go.

499
00:35:44,848 --> 00:35:46,231
Where now?

500
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:50,301
Tomorrow, once again, same time, same place.

501
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,317
Ah.

502
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:09,124
Okubo-san was accused of being the
killer of a high school girl.

503
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:13,141
He met the real killer here, and died.

504
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:17,195
With the Tengu watching from the top
of the cedar trees.

505
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:19,151
I thought the Tengu weren't involved.

506
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,946
To try and protect Jun from
the terrible thing he'd seen,

507
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:26,353
the Tengu took the memory of the event from him.

508
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:33,098
Do you think a woman would be strong enough
to pull him up that high?

509
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:36,164
- It can't be done.
- A woman?

510
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:39,134
Do you mean, his wife?

511
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:44,176
Three years ago, she thought Kozue-san was
cheating with her husband and killed her?

512
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:47,175
Does that mean she killed Okubo-san too?

513
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:50,112
Shh.

514
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:53,131
I can feel the Tengu nearby.

515
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:57,202
I can hear their voices all around us
in the forest.

516
00:36:57,272 --> 00:37:00,205
And on the day we found Okubo-san

517
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:03,275
I heard the same voice.

518
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:35,210
What was that?

519
00:37:48,173 --> 00:37:51,239
An urban myth! I've found one!

520
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:53,309
Huh?

521
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,396
Agh!

522
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:03,101
A... person?

523
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:06,171
What's wrong?
 Are you lost?

524
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,193
Why are you up there at this time of day?

525
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:11,143
I'm observing the flying squirrel.

526
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:14,112
This is its mating season.

527
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:18,150
Every night I keep an eye on them until morning.

528
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,219
Well, in that case...

529
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:24,122
Did you see this child here, two days ago?

530
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:27,112
Yes, I saw a child going for a walk with an adult.

531
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:29,194
With this guy, right?

532
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:31,296
- No, not him.
- What?

533
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:35,366
That's not the person the child was walking with.

534
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:41,122
Tannai-san, I know who the murderer is!

535
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:43,195
That's not important!
Jun's gone missing!

536
00:38:43,245 --> 00:38:45,183
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

537
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:47,245
He can't have got far!

538
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,628
- Split up and search the area!
- Sir!

539
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:55,990
Tannai-san, I know who the murderer is!

540
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,958
That's not important!
Jun's gone missing!

541
00:38:58,008 --> 00:38:59,974
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

542
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:02,076
He can't have got far!

543
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:04,459
- Split up and search the area!
- Sir!

544
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:12,386
So, you still can't remember anything?

545
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:15,456
- No.
- Is that so?

546
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:30,472
Jun! Look out!

547
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:40,448
Sorry about this.

548
00:40:06,476 --> 00:40:09,309
Jun! 
Are you okay?

549
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:13,330
I've found him!
Over here!

550
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,365
The police?!

551
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:19,303
Weren't you about to kill this boy?

552
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,305
What?

553
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:25,459
It's a misunderstanding.
We were having a walk.

554
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:27,529
Otonashi!

555
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:32,484
Tsukiko-san!

556
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:36,538
Jun! Jun!

557
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,374
There was no misunderstanding.

558
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:43,444
You wanted to kill Jun.

559
00:40:46,383 --> 00:40:51,301
Okubo-san was looking for the real murderer
from three years ago.

560
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:53,370
It was you, wasn't it?

561
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,405
Huh? What do you mean?

562
00:40:55,475 --> 00:41:00,475
You regularly used compensated dating

563
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:06,499
and one day you were paired with
one of your own students.

564
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:12,488
Well, I'm very pleased to find you doing this.

565
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,292
How much is it?

566
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:19,329
I don't do that kind of thing.

567
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:21,381
Well, you say that now

568
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:25,385
but I have a list of everyone doing
this kind of thing

569
00:41:25,455 --> 00:41:28,455
and I noticed your and Risa's name on it.

570
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:33,360
If that list got out

571
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,430
it would finish you all. 
Totally.

572
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:44,271
Now what are you doing?

573
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:47,290
I'm going to tell Okubo-sensei about you.

574
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,359
He'll know what to do.

575
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:52,482
What? Stop.
Give me that! Give!

576
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:01,470
Just to save your reputation, you killed her.

577
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:05,308
No.

578
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:09,296
Okubo-san realised you were the murderer.

579
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:12,215
So you took Jun to the woods.

580
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:14,317
This is all wrong!

581
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:18,405
We know you were with Jun at the
murder scene because

582
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:20,475
we have a witness.

583
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:30,499
With Jun as a hostage, you convinced
Okubo-san to come.

584
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:36,289
Kunieda, why don't you hand yourself
in to the police?

585
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:40,377
- I have Jun with me.
- "What?"

586
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:44,447
I don't want to kill your child.

587
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,470
We'll meet tomorrow morning.
I'll explain where...

588
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:57,456
And that's how you were able to kill
him without a second thought.

589
00:43:13,446 --> 00:43:17,446
However, Jun saw the whole thing.

590
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:22,402
Father... father...

591
00:43:22,472 --> 00:43:25,472
I told you to wait!

592
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:29,396
Why are you here?!

593
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:46,425
There was a sudden wind, right?
With the sound of laughter?

594
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:52,499
This was the Tengu.

595
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:59,471
It came from Mt Takao, to protect Jun.

596
00:44:03,396 --> 00:44:07,347
Well, I wouldn't know.
Because none of it happened.

597
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:11,334
Do you have any evidence?
Any at all?

598
00:44:11,404 --> 00:44:13,220
I have some evidence for you!

599
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,305
Gohara?

600
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:18,428
There were some hair strands from the Love Hotel.

601
00:44:18,478 --> 00:44:22,603
If we check it against your DNA, we'll
know whose words to believe.

602
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:28,417
Was it really you?
 A student and an adult?

603
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,306
Funny, isn't it?

604
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:38,361
You were his wife, but 
you were the first to suspect him.

605
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:41,414
Okubo-san!

606
00:44:41,484 --> 00:44:43,484
Screw you!

607
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,357
Look like the demon Tannai is back.

608
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:53,490
Assaulting the suspect just makes more paperwork.

609
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:59,336
He just did what the mother wanted to do.
And it still wasn't enough.

610
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:02,319
- Okay, let's go.
- Excellent work, guys!

611
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:05,372
You can't hit suspects!
He dare hit me!

612
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:07,324
Keep walking.

613
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:09,446
It's a good job they took him away,
right, Tannai-san?

614
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:12,496
- Well, whatever.
 Let's head back.
- Sir!

615
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:21,488
Jun, look at this.

616
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:28,463
Why did you come?!

617
00:45:37,374 --> 00:45:39,272
Uncle Kunieda said

618
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:42,309
we were going to meet dad

619
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:45,328
That's why I went with him.

620
00:45:45,398 --> 00:45:48,315
You did nothing wrong.

621
00:45:48,385 --> 00:45:52,269
The Tengu don't protect bad people.

622
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:55,438
So when the Tengu do help you, you can be sure

623
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:58,508
you're someone special.

624
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:07,400
Do you remember?
 Anything about the Tengu?

625
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,470
Yes.

626
00:46:10,557 --> 00:46:13,557
They helped me.

627
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:17,478
That's good.

628
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:26,419
I'm sorry.

629
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:30,489
I'm sorry, Jun.

630
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
So sorry...

631
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:50,327
You must think I'm a terrible wife...

632
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:55,402
I was married to him and we lived together but
 I never gave him a chance. 
Not really.

633
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:57,287
Once you call yourself a couple

634
00:46:57,337 --> 00:47:00,440
There are things you cannot see, but
are still there.

635
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,490
That's right, Tannai-san.
Experience tells us so.

636
00:47:05,478 --> 00:47:08,478
Thank you so much for everything you've done.

637
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:11,414
- See you.
- Bye bye.

638
00:47:11,484 --> 00:47:13,484
Bye bye.

639
00:47:14,537 --> 00:47:17,537
So maybe the Tengu are real...

640
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:23,259
- Otonashi.
- Yes.

641
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:26,383
You may have heard around the office that
I'm separated from my wife

642
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:29,315
What?!
 Really?
I had no idea!

643
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:31,317
Don't act dumb.

644
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:34,304
It must be very hard for you.

645
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:37,323
I don't need your sympathy.

646
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:40,346
By the way, sorry for not believing you earlier.

647
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:43,329
- Huh?

648
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:46,316
Today, when I was in the forest I filmed this

649
00:47:46,386 --> 00:47:50,303
but it's not a person and it's not a bird either.

650
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:52,355
Eh?

651
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:56,425
- Wow! This is it!
- Let me see.

652
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:59,345
What the -?

653
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:01,351
Didn't you film this from the TV?

654
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:03,353
It's gone.
Katsuura. 
Where did it go?

655
00:48:03,403 --> 00:48:05,472
- The clip's been 
deleted!
- What? Deleted?

656
00:48:05,522 --> 00:48:08,522
- How is that possible?
- It can't have gone.

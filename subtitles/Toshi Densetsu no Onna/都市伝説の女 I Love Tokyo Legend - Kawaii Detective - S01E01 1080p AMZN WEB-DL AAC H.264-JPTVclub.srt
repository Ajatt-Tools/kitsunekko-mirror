1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
TOKYO,
SHINBASHI

2
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,621
Can I keep this?

3
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,691
This isn't just any old ticket.
It has a deeper meaning.

4
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,548
Okay.

5
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:23,564
-- timing: onctom --

6
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:34,577
-- subs: ersby --

7
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:46,278
Why are you wasting my time like this?

8
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:48,481
Are you on my team or not?

9
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,551
Sorry, Gohara-san.
Really sorry.

10
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:59,257
After you.

11
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,393
Thanks.

12
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,388
(sigh)

13
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,458
I guess my way is out of date...

14
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,346
Tannai-san's way is still the best.

15
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:26,421
What are you talking about?
Half the time you guys don't listen to a word that I say.

16
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,471
What's so funny?

17
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,314
Ah, I'm tired.

18
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,876
Excuse me?

19
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,301
Name?

20
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,370
I'm Otonashi Tsukiko.
So?

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,306
I start here today.

22
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,259
There must be some mistake.
Get out.

23
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,328
Is it okay to sit here?

24
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:55,363
No, it isn't!

25
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:59,351
Look at those clothes.
What kind of cop dresses like that?

26
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,369
This is plain clothes, right?

27
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,439
Someone explain to her...

28
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,496
Phew.

29
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,265
What's she laughing at?

30
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:18,336
- It's just a ticket?
- Don't you know?

31
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,327
See the numbers here? I've heard that
these four numbers can tell the future.

32
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:25,327
Take the two ones as being two people

33
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:28,383
Then the number in the middle is
the % chance of love.

34
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,319
You've heard this too, right?
This morning when I bought this ticket

35
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:34,336
I saw ninety-four percent!!
Isn't that amazing?

36
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,358
So you see, this ticket is saying

37
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,376
That I am shortly going to meet my one true love.

38
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,308
What kind of nonsense is this?

39
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:43,348
It's a well-known urban legend:
the fortune-telling ticket stub.

40
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,347
- Huh?
- Ah, sorry.

41
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,421
- It's probably not your thing.
- Are you really a police officer?

42
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,471
Yes. Look.

43
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,308
"Investigation Team, assigned to Tannai"?

44
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:59,364
Ah, is there somewhere I can plug this in?

45
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,312
Plug...

46
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:03,398
- Just here.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:07,468
- You're helpful, aren't you Ando?
- Well, of course.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Done it. Okay.

49
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,300
(phone)

50
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,319
Hello?

51
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,287
Yes... yes.

52
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:28,440
What? Got it!

53
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,510
A body of a man has been found in Otemachi.

54
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:42,303
Estimated time of death is around
eleven o'clock last night.

55
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:45,477
There aren't many people around here at that time.

56
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:48,527
He was found by a man on his way to work.

57
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,418
So he jumped from here...

58
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:58,488
Tannai-san

59
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,289
We've confirmed his identity.

60
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:06,361
Fujisawa Masashi.
38.
Worked as an electrician for Higano Electrics.

61
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,444
Huh? What's this?

62
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:29,384
Kastuura, could you help me sort this out?

63
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,454
Sure...

64
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,306
Your collar.
It was bent.

65
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,325
Er, thanks.

66
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,344
But I was referring to

67
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,429
this case.

68
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,499
Excuse me.
Sorry.

69
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,472
Hup!

70
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,295
There was no note but
he left his shoes on the roof.

71
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:56,311
It's suicide.

72
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,347
I don't want to make a fuss but

73
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,469
I'd like a word with you afterwards.

74
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,957
- Hey, don't speak like that -
- Enough.

75
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:09,324
Oi! What are you doing?

76
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:11,359
In the olden days

77
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:16,317
a barrier was built around Edo Castle and
this is one of it's power spots.

78
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,319
So they say if you do stretching exercises here

79
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,355
you'll feel stronger and more refreshed.

80
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,387
Woah...

81
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:26,324
Wait a second!
Her?
She's your new member?

82
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:28,376
Otonashi Tsukiko.

83
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:30,446
Tsukiko...

84
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,499
- May I just...?
- Huh?

85
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:42,273
When he died he was looking this way.

86
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:45,446
Um, I'm Katsuura from Forensics.
Pleased to meet you.

87
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:47,496
But...

88
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,472
Found it!

89
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:04,295
Tannai-san.
This case involves a genuine urban myth!

90
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,381
- Huh? What's that?
- And so

91
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:10,701
Solving this case will unlock the truth
behind the urban myth itself!

92
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,470
What's going on here?

93
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,275
I'm the manager, Yoshida.

94
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,294
It came as a great shock to hear about suicide.

95
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:55,346
We're still investigating...

96
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,398
but what is all this?

97
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,388
Higano Electrics probably think
it's better to be respectful.

98
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,438
Otonashi...

99
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,288
That's the shrine to Taira no Masakado.

100
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,323
So what?

101
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:27,622
Years ago, the Ministry of Finance was building
a temporary shrine to replace the real one and

102
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,317
on the work site, there was a mysterious death.

103
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,352
- Coincidence.
- After that,

104
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:36,321
there was a series of accidents at the
Ministry until the shrine was restored.

105
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,278
After the war, they tried to remove it again but
the bulldozer tipped over.

106
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,363
This also resulted in casualties.

107
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:45,413
- These things happen.
- What are you getting at?

108
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,298
Pardon me.

109
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:49,437
Ever since Tokyo was called Edo,
going back generations,

110
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,487
People have known about it.

111
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:54,600
And so,

112
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,327
this shrine is the location of an urban myth.

113
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:02,350
Our chairman is very much aware of
Taira no Masakado.

114
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,318
In the past, an employee threw rubbish
from here and later had an accident.

115
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:11,342
When an employee threw out a cigarette butt
he returned to his house to find it on fire.

116
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,311
And there are many stories like this.

117
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:20,348
The company decided that any windows overlooking
the shrine should be closed and covered.

118
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,420
Well, you could call it superstition.

119
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,470
Come to think of it,
that body was looking at the shrine.

120
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:33,261
Exactly.
So the death of Fujisawa

121
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,347
and the curse of Masakado are linked.

122
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,419
- Curse?
- No, there's no such thing.

123
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:41,319
Since he left his shoes neatly on the roof...

124
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,389
- Suicide?

125
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,459
Well, he did have a heavy workload.

126
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:52,363
Ah, I'm Director Hagino.

127
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,433
Hagino-san?

128
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:58,302
He was my grandfather.

129
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:01,325
He was the first in our family to
establish this company.

130
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,311
You know, in family companies...

131
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,343
What?!

132
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:07,462
Pressure was he under?

133
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:12,532
Well, he didn't really get on with his manager...

134
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,488
He wasn't very flexible.

135
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,328
You keep making us work like this
while profits are falling.

136
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:23,411
Why won't anyone say anything?

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,306
Chiho-san.
Did you hear about Fujisawa?

138
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:55,359
- Huh?
- Everyone's talking about it.

139
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,429
It...
was the curse wasn't it?

140
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,335
Of course, everyone else thinks so too.

141
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:03,367
What? Who are you?

142
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,437
She's police.

143
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:09,357
What do you know about the curse?

144
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:14,328
Recently Fukisawa-san was seen going up to the roof

145
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,400
- The roof?
- Just a few days ago.

146
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,263
He had a really scared expression on
his face as he came down.

147
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,339
Are you okay?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

148
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,341
I heard a voice.

149
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:30,298
- What voice was it?
I think it was Masakado's voice he heard.

150
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,313
Masakado's voice?

151
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,333
Calling from the other world?

152
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,371
He'd often look down at the shrine.

153
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,320
This could be it.

154
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,322
I've got it.

155
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:43,441
Got it got it got it...

156
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,511
Just as I thought, I was right all along.

157
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:49,333
What the hell is all this about?

158
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,402
Is Fujisawa's death not interesting enough for you?

159
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:55,452
- Is that how it looks?
- That's all I can see.

160
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,242
Hmmm.

161
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,364
This is the apartment of the victim, Fujisawa.

162
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,363
He lived here alone?

163
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,353
If we can find something like a note
we can confirm that it's suicide.

164
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:11,302
Ah, here she is.

165
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,421
So cute.

166
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:17,491
The man loved cleanliness.

167
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,450
He really did love cleanliness.

168
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:32,390
Hm.

169
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
Ah.

170
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,353
What are you doing?

171
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,408
This special between season four and five.

172
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,340
It should be like this.

173
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,259
Oh...

174
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,327
That's bad.

175
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,331
If it's a bent collar or a DVD collection

176
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,420
Once you mess with the crime scene,
you can't do forensics.

177
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,290
Well, it's better if things are as we found them

178
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,308
but since it's not the crime scene,
just put it back the way it was.

179
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:08,312
- Okay. I remeber the order.
- Oi, Forensics. What are you doing?

180
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,328
Just investigating...

181
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,458
Okay. Phew.

182
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,458
"Goodbye"

183
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,274
So there was a note.
He'd left it in the house.

184
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:39,340
It's definitely suicide.

185
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,393
- I don't think so.
- What d'you mean?

186
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:46,263
Certainly, Fujisawa-san may have jumped,

187
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,351
but was there someone else who made him jump?

188
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,353
Murder?

189
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:55,323
No. This is neither murder nor suicide.

190
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:59,343
It's the curse.
Masakado's revenge.

191
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:01,345
Bullshit!!

192
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:04,332
Screw Masakado.
And screw the curse.

193
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,337
That's nothing to do with this case.

194
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:12,306
Hey, newbie.
If it's suicide, we can finish the report with
one sentence.

195
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:18,299
If I don't have that report tomorrow morning then
I'll send you right back to traffic warden!

196
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:21,485
And I'll make damned sure you're
never allowed to be a detective again!

197
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,535
Got that? Good!

198
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,409
It's been a while since I heard the famous
"demon voice of Tannai's"

199
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,459
Is that right?

200
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,328
Huh? Are you alone?

201
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:54,315
Do you fancy some food or...?

202
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,350
To prove the curse

203
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,304
- I have to disprove both suicide and homocide.
- Huh?

204
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,444
There are women in that company who know the truth.

205
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:08,744
Fujisawa-san had just been transferred there.
he wouldn't have known about the curse.

206
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,319
But he looked down on the shrine
he was overcome with despair.

207
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:31,385
You really love that stuff.
Urban myths and legends.

208
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:37,311
The thing about urban legends a lot of them are
told as jokes or stange old tales

209
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,361
but there must be some truth in there somewhere.

210
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,299
So I think that they influence things today.

211
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,298
What things?

212
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:49,356
Recently, police techniques have developed so
when I think about all these unsolved cases...

213
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,273
- It's a pity, don't you think?
- I guess...

214
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:56,343
That's why I became a detective.

215
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,346
So I could take this list of unsolved crimes

216
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,265
And shed some light on them.

217
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,302
I see.
I like these kinds of stories too.

218
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,338
Really?
Urban myths?

219
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:10,327
- We can talk about this over dinner, perhaps.
- Hey, which do you know?

220
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,296
- The tunnels under the National Diet building?
- Not really, no.

221
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,331
- Or the rumour about Speilberg?
- Speilberg?

222
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,363
Ah, the director of Star Wars?

223
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,316
Perhaps not.

224
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:22,273
If you don't know, then there's
no point in talking about it.

225
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:24,338
Sorry.

226
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:28,409
But, there's something about the case
that keeps bothering me.

227
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,792
At the scene,
we found a small bit of mud on the body.

228
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:38,469
Mud...

229
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:43,290
- What? What?
- Hey, Katsuura...

230
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,363
If you find anything else like that,
let me know, okay?

231
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:49,430
Before anyone else.

232
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Absolutely.

233
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,406
- Okay, shall we go?
- Let's go? Okay.

234
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,956
- You mean, go and eat?
- Yep.

235
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,358
- Is this it?

236
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:04,491
Ah, perhaps we'll go somewhere
after this. Gotcha.

237
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,331
Sorry for making you wait.

238
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,151
What are you doing at eleven at night that
makes you so busy?

239
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,739
Are you here to talk about my alibi?

240
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,392
Wasn't it suicide?

241
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:21,462
We're just making 100% sure it's not murder.

242
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,466
In that case...

243
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,335
The whole sales team are my alibi.

244
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:30,304
Huh?

245
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:33,307
I was holding a party for them.
In my house.

246
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:37,428
Apart from Fujisawa, everyone was there.

247
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:40,498
They were all at my place until after midnight.

248
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:47,324
Apart from people in the company,
there's no one else who could've pushed him.

249
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:50,377
So that means the number of suspects
is getting smaller.

250
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:53,427
Well, if you think we're making progress

251
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:57,185
Perhaps we can celebrate by
getting a bite to eat somewhere.

252
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,485
Don't worry.

253
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,326
I told them I was with all the managers
until the middle of the night

254
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,324
Thank you so much for coming.

255
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,411
If I said that you were the first to leave alone

256
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,481
that would make them suspicious.

257
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:21,322
What?
A stomach ache?

258
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:26,327
"I'm in the hospital reception now,
but it's not very busy."

259
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:31,465
Hey, cop.
You can't take a day off because
you're feeling a bit ill.

260
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:33,785
She's ill?
It's only her second day.

261
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,254
Tsukiko Otonashi-san to desk three, please.

262
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,356
Okay.

263
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:43,344
They just called me.
I'll be in touch just as soon as I'm done.

264
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,312
Otonashi, you -

265
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:47,398
She hung up.

266
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,468
This idiot hung up on me!

267
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:15,155
You're enthusiastic for one so young.

268
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:21,528
Hm, I've not seen you here before.

269
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:23,616
Do you come here often?

270
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:28,470
Masakado-san went through a lot to be our hero.

271
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,524
Hero? Isn't he supposed to be frightening?

272
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:35,542
No, no.

273
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:40,514
For generations now, this man has
been a hero in this neighbourhood.

274
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:44,521
He fought for the rights of the people
against an autocratic court

275
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:48,672
And tried to make a new country here in Kanto.

276
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:53,742
The people of Kanto were suffering and
needed liberating.

277
00:19:55,582 --> 00:20:01,585
Even some employees of these offices
have said they're sorry.

278
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:03,537
That suicide...

279
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:09,627
The Great Masakado would gladly hear his wishes,
but...

280
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:12,697
Huh? What do you mean?

281
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:22,573
After Masakado was defeated, the head was taken to Kyoto.

282
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:29,446
But by itself, it was able to fly back here.

283
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:33,534
The head?
Flew?
From Kyoto?

284
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,536
Yes.

285
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:39,523
It was the desire to return to his homeland, yes?

286
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:42,526
In memory of that story

287
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:46,530
these frogs were placed here.

288
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,534
Office workers whose feel like they
have been forgotten

289
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,520
come here so that their wishes can be heard.

290
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,541
Again and again they stop here on their way to the office

291
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,576
And he was one of those people.

292
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:04,615
Fujisawa-san?
He used to work here?

293
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:09,685
Perhaps it slipped the manager's mind.

294
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:18,532
Just because he didn't know about it,
doesn't mean there isn't a curse.

295
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:23,550
So then, why bother with going to the roof so much?

296
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
- Ah.
- Hm?

297
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:44,521
I knew it!
It's from Haruki!

298
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:49,593
Look out for the Big Dipper and the barrier of iron.

299
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:51,548
- It says.
- What sort of code is that?

300
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:54,531
Big Dipper...

301
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:57,538
In the metropolitan area,
including the Kanda Myojin shrine and burial ground,

302
00:21:57,588 --> 00:22:00,537
There are seven shrines to Masakado.

303
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:02,539
Join these with a line

304
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:05,509
and it looks like the Big Dipper.

305
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,548
The Meiji government wanted to break the curse

306
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:11,535
So they built the Yamamoto line as
a barrier of iron between them.

307
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:13,554
At least, that's how the story goes.

308
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:18,505
But what did he mean by "take care"?

309
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:23,544
Has something weakened the power
of the Yamamoto line?

310
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:26,497
Wh...
who is that?
Haruki?

311
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:30,534
After the barrier collapses
something terrible might happen.

312
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:32,523
But how did you know you were
going to get that text

313
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:34,558
- Even before it...
- Oh, I just know.

314
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,623
Texts, phone calls.
Usually.

315
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,693
Usually?

316
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,528
Thanks, Haruki.

317
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:46,620
- First, we have to solve the curse of Masakado.
- But who is this Haruki, anyway?

318
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,670
This could be bad...

319
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:55,694
Ah!

320
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,482
Aah!

321
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:03,567
Yoshida?!
Boss?

322
00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:06,637
Quick! Someone call an ambulance!

323
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:15,612
What happened to Yoshida-san?

324
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:18,682
He had a sudden heart attack.

325
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:21,451
Could it be the curse?

326
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:25,539
What was that?
Isn't the investigation over?

327
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,544
Isn't that Chiho's seat over there?

328
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:30,531
I have a couple of things to ask her.
Where is she?

329
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:35,516
We're not supposed to talk to any outsiders
unless it's necessary.

330
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:39,586
I won't tell anyone

331
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:41,656
Please.

332
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:15,914
The building where Fujisawa-san jumped from
was the one where he used to work.

333
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:19,152
His boss demoted him because he would always argue.

334
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:24,786
But why did he go to the roof so often?

335
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:28,990
Unlike you, I don't have time for childish theories

336
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Childish?
Is that how I look?

337
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:35,947
You're a detective, but you dress like that.

338
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:41,836
I guess dressing like that means the guys
treat you well.

339
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,839
That's right.
So, since I'm still young,

340
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,843
I thought I'd like a little pampering.

341
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:52,851
If you just show a bit of leg,
suddenly people are a lot more co-operative.

342
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:56,818
The police force is a man's world

343
00:24:56,888 --> 00:25:00,905
If it works and you've got it, then why not use it?

344
00:25:03,978 --> 00:25:06,845
You're a sly one, aren't you?

345
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:08,930
Well...

346
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Is that an engamement ring?

347
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:16,037
Yes. I'm engaged.

348
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:19,008
To Hagino Ryoichi-san?

349
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:25,964
Sorry, but I saw you two together.

350
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,835
Ah, do you have a cat?

351
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:34,923
If a cat sneezes near a bride on the
morning of the wedding

352
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,118
then she will have a happy marriage...
so they say.

353
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:45,900
I saw that yesterday.

354
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,970
That frog on your strap.

355
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,992
Are you waiting for someone?

356
00:25:56,981 --> 00:26:00,981
Perhaps you were praying that
Fujisawa-san would come back?

357
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:05,987
Why? I haven't told anyone.

358
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:09,058
I worked it out myself.

359
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:13,778
Yesterday, you were that upset.

360
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:15,864
What the hell is all this about?

361
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:19,834
When I seemed amused by Fujisawa's death.

362
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:24,889
You see, when you heard about Fujisawa,

363
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:28,959
it upset you very much.
Right?

364
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:38,002
Fujisawa-san was my boyfriend for a while.

365
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:43,925
But we had a difficult break up.

366
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:46,995
After that, I started seeing Hagino-san.

367
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,820
We held a party two days ago to announce
our engagement.

368
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,806
I wish you two every happiness...

369
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:56,938
Cheers!

370
00:26:57,008 --> 00:27:01,008
And that was the night Fujisawa died?

371
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,902
I should throw this away... I suppose.

372
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,799
Tsukiko-san?

373
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:28,870
"Perhaps this is a normal suicide after all"

374
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,823
I see.
That's just as well.

375
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:34,846
We looked everywhere, but
there's one thing that doesn't make sense.

376
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:37,829
"Eh? What thing?"

377
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,831
That piece of mud.

378
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:43,868
"Futsuura-san, why don't you come round?"

379
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:45,938
What?
To your place?!

380
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:51,978
Coming.

381
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:55,456
She's already asked me to her place...

382
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:59,834
Sorry, just drying my hair.
Come in.

383
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:01,920
Okay...

384
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,990
Thanks...

385
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,915
This is a nice place.

386
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:16,985
I bought this.
Is that okay?

387
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:33,768
Um...

388
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:52,837
So.
What is it?

389
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,822
Hm?

390
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:58,843
About the mud.
What did you find?

391
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,828
Oh, that...

392
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:03,781
The pollen we found doesn't come from the mud.

393
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:05,833
Pollen?
What pollen?

394
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:07,835
Chinese Bellflower.

395
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,854
Bellflower?

396
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:12,860
But there's no Chinese Bellflower in that area.

397
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,944
And it usually doesn't flower until around June.

398
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:20,014
I mean bloom naturally.

399
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:23,885
Strange, that.

400
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:27,268
Did he stop at the Botanical Gardens
before he jumped?

401
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,825
- Got it.
- Hm?

402
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,944
- Eh? Eh?

403
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:35,077
- I've got it, Katsuura!
- Got it?

404
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,786
A visitor?

405
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:43,855
Ah. I thought we were alone.

406
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:45,857
I'm her sister, Miyako.

407
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,809
Oh, I see.

408
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:50,832
If you'd said Msakado and Bellfower before
I could have made the connection much sooner.

409
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:55,900
This is definitely it.
The incident certain involves Msakado.

410
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,819
I can write that report now.

411
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:00,822
Tsukiko-san, you said "got it"...

412
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:02,807
"Got it."

413
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:06,728
Sorry about that.
Once she's like this, she can't be stopped.

414
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,831
- I wouldn't even bother waiting.
- Ah.

415
00:30:11,886 --> 00:30:14,919
Well, I bought this too.

416
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,989
Hm, thanks.

417
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:21,843
So, tell me about Haruki?

418
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:24,912
- Her ex-boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?!

419
00:30:24,982 --> 00:30:26,982
Ah. Her ex. Ex.

420
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,855
Sorry I was ill yesterday.

421
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:35,923
Here's the report.

422
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:39,993
Staying healthy is an important part
of police work.

423
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:48,836
What kind of report is this?

424
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:51,859
Fujisawa-san's body had grain of pollen stuck to it.

425
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:54,829
This is the strongest evidence showing
that the curse of Masakado was involved.

426
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,864
Now, if I can explain the connection...

427
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:59,831
Shut up!
Masakado again!

428
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:03,868
You're fired!
You're police career is over.

429
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:07,938
You'll never be allowed to carry a
badge again. Hah!

430
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:11,843
- What's this?

431
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,881
Ha ha ha, doesn't look very busy this morning.

432
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:16,918
- Ah, the Assistant Commissioner.
- (all) Good morning!

433
00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:19,968
Good morning.
Tsukiko, my love.

434
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,820
"My love"?

435
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,939
And good morning, Takeshi, dear.

436
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,009
"Dear?"

437
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:30,798
Should I say, "Assistant Commissioner."

438
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,847
How adorable.

439
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:35,870
Just knowing I can see your sweet smile
in the morning

440
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,905
- makes coming to work all worthwhile.
- A ha ha...

441
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:42,824
Assistant Commissioner.
How do you know Otonashi?

442
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:47,862
Well, we meet now and then.
Keep up the good work.

443
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:49,997
Yes!

444
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:52,954
If there's anything you need, just send me an email.

445
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:55,004
Ah, I almost forgot!

446
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:06,931
So that's how it is.

447
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:11,001
Suddenly I feel very tired.

448
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,991
Hey hey, good morning.

449
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:19,777
What's with this mood?

450
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:23,847
How are you getting on with that sucide case?
Made much progress?

451
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,968
- It's almost finished.
- I see, I see.

452
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,038
Then you won't mind taking another case.

453
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:36,848
I want you to record the movements of a suspect
for the next 24 hours. Stick to him like glue.

454
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:39,947
Is this about the serial killer case?

455
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:42,330
It's probably best if you don't know.

456
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:48,789
Understand?
Today, just stick to the basics.

457
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:51,859
And I don't what to hear any whining from you.

458
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,764
Who is this person I'm tailing?

459
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,950
The less you know, the happier I am.

460
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,188
Stay with him for twenty four hours and
make a record of everything he does. Got it?

461
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:08,994
That's not safe...

462
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:11,846
Where are you looking?

463
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,818
You're supposed to be watching the entrance.

464
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,933
Yes, but...
you'd better move.

465
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:20,003
Is this about the curse again?
Don't waste my time again!

466
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,961
Aagh!

467
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:29,982
Ow... ow...

468
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:43,012
Katsuura! Katsuura!

469
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:46,015
What are you doing?

470
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:49,937
This is related to the investigation.

471
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,362
- Detective?
- That's right.
Excuse me.

472
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,839
Katsuura!

473
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,945
The curse of Msakado finally
caught up with the boss!

474
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,995
Hay, Katsuura.

475
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:04,852
The curse of Msakado finally
caught up with the boss!

476
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:07,838
- Huh, Tannai-san?
- I was able to escape unharmed

477
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:10,838
But now I think I have proof of the curse.

478
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,860
- What's this girl on about?
- Beats me.

479
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,842
Proof?

480
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,827
When Fujisawa killed himself

481
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:18,849
He was looking down at the shrine from the roof.

482
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,948
Uh huh.

483
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:28,122
I don't believe it myself.
About the curse.

484
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,160
Of course you do.
Policemen often think that way.

485
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,276
Here.

486
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,346
Take this.

487
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:39,250
Kanda Myojin.
It's where Masakado is enshrined.

488
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Take care.

489
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,183
If I record something weird, what should I do?

490
00:34:56,253 --> 00:35:00,566
In ten minutes it'll be the same time
as when Fujisawa killed himself.

491
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:05,109
This is for you.
Hm?

492
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:08,115
Use this and try and see the shrine down there.

493
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:10,164
- Why me?!
- I'm too scared.

494
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,133
- But I'm scared too.
- But you'll have this.

495
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:15,135
No way!
Absolutely not!

496
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:19,223
- I'm going home.
- Pathetic.
Call yourself a cop?

497
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:22,293
- Fine, then.
- Sorry.

498
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:33,691
If it looks like I'm going to fall, just
hang on with all your strength.

499
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,162
I really don't think this is a good idea.

500
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:41,161
- Whether or not there's a curse -
- There is.

501
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:46,116
I have also been spirited away.
What.

502
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:50,137
For three days, people searched for me
but I couldn't be found.

503
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:53,210
It was while I was researching what happened
to me during those three days

504
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,246
that I started to be interested in urban legends.

505
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:59,671
Weren't you kidnapped?
Nope. Spirited away.
I was five.

506
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:05,736
All I can remember is a large black
shadow with wings.

507
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,306
Wings?
Like a bird?

508
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:15,212
Whatever took me might have been a person or not

509
00:36:15,282 --> 00:36:19,282
It might have been a bird or not.

510
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,152
It had wings from its back,
and it could walk and fly.

511
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:33,296
- It was...
- It was...?

512
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,719
A Tengu.
(a mythical bird-like demon)

513
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:55,235
Woah!

514
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:57,305
- Agh!
- Tsukiko-san!

515
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,108
Are you okay?

516
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,127
I'll pull you back up.

517
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:11,251
(distant laughter)

518
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:13,321
What's that?

519
00:37:14,224 --> 00:37:18,108
Is... this the urban legend?
Got it!

520
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:34,161
Everyone,
today I've brought you here to Kando Myojin shrine:

521
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,230
The most important piece in this puzzle.

522
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,280
This is where Masakado was enshrined.

523
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,786
Otonashi!
What are you up to now?

524
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:50,190
In order to show that Fujisawa's death
was a result of the curse

525
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,127
I continued to investigate the case.

526
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:55,095
Just go home, Otonashi.

527
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:56,228
Unfortunately,

528
00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:00,217
as I worked on it,
the case took a turn for the worse.

529
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,287
What are you talking about?

530
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:09,076
Last night I stood on the roof of that building.

531
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:12,179
And I was able to hear this terrible laughter.

532
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:16,133
The floor below the roof is the president's offices.

533
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:19,136
What about it?

534
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:22,239
Sounds from the room leaked out.

535
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:30,217
The chairman had invited young women to
these rooms for a party.

536
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,267
Drinking expensive wine, laughing loudly.

537
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:37,107
As company performance fell,
and the firm was restructured,

538
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:40,107
The Chairman has been living this lifestyle.

539
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:43,626
Yoshida-san, you are experts in your field but

540
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:47,150
it's clear that the company is not doing well.

541
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,133
Fujisawa saw that and tried to change it.

542
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,136
Otonashi.
Get to the point.

543
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:56,139
Fujisawa-san has been recording conversations

544
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,510
in the Chairman's offices from the roof.

545
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:03,589
When I went into his apartment earlier, I
thought it was odd.

546
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:07,596
That someone so neat and tidy would leave his
DVDs out of order.

547
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,646
That was a sign to search there

548
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,716
inside the only DVD that was upisde down.

549
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,721
And this is what I found.
An I.C. Recorder.

550
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,791
If we press play...

551
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:27,596
"Ryoichi.
It looks like I lost quite a bit at the casino
last night.

552
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,615
"Ahh, we can cover that up."

553
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:31,620
You can continue.
Put it on the company card.

554
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,602
Don't get complacent, Ryoichi.

555
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,738
That's enough.

556
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:38,871
I've been troubling my grandson.
We'll find a way.

557
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:48,570
Fujisawa-san tried to uncover the fraud before
it brought the company down.

558
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,607
With a little more time, he might have succeeded.

559
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:54,623
But somehow Higashino-san found out

560
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:57,610
about what Fujisawa-san was doing.

561
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,649
So you held a party in a nearby apartment block.

562
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,535
Higino-san called
Fujisawa-san to meet him at a building.

563
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:06,785
Building?
This is nonsense.

564
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:11,724
To the top of the Hagino building, to be exact.

565
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:16,794
No one lives nearby, so
there's no one to hear any screaming.

566
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:21,234
Are you serious?

567
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:28,591
You'll bring down the company.

568
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,660
I'm the one that's protecting the company!

569
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,697
So you won't reconsider?

570
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:38,767
I think the Chairman would reconsider
once everyone resigns.

571
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,773
I see...

572
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,616
What?

573
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:55,584
Stop that!
Stop!

574
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:58,704
Wait!
Wait a second!

575
00:40:58,774 --> 00:41:00,774
Aaargh!

576
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:14,820
- But he didn't jump from that building.
- Wrong.

577
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,943
Otonashi.
What evidence do you have to support this?

578
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:20,993
A Chinese Bellflower.
Bellflower?

579
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,813
Maskado had seven doubles.

580
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:32,941
Yet he was betrayed by his lover who knew the
defining feature that could tell him apart

581
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,304
and she told his enemies how they could identify him.

582
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,950
The name of this woman was Kikyo, or
Chinese Bellflower.

583
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,793
When I heard that they'd found pollen
from a Chinese Bellflower

584
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,826
I was convinced the curse was involved.

585
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:55,914
You thought the two were related?

586
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,813
That's right.

587
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,783
What's Forensics doing here?

588
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:04,803
We did a thorough search of the Hagino building

589
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:08,807
Inside we found a Chinese Bellflower plant.

590
00:42:08,877 --> 00:42:10,809
And, for some reason,

591
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:12,795
it was already in bloom.

592
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:19,802
I see now.
The pollen on his clothes...

593
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,805
So we conducted a new search of the area.

594
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:31,733
Although it had been mostly washed away,
we found traces of blood.

595
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,767
Blood?
Enough for a DNA sample?

596
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:36,802
It was Fujisawa-san's.

597
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:37,994
Huh? So...

598
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:42,958
why was Fujisawa's body taken from there

599
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:46,028
and placed in Otemachi?
- Wait!

600
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,983
I mean...
I'm not the criminal!

601
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,210
- Wait!

602
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,343
I'm not the criminal.
I have an alibi.
Isn't that right, dad?

603
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,413
- Hmm.
- Chiho.

604
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,785
I see you haven't thrown that frog away yet.

605
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:18,013
If you know anything, then
now's the time to say it.

606
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,647
This man... is a liar.

607
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:25,149
What the...?

608
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,219
Hey, Chiho.
What is this?

609
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:33,107
You killed him.
Both of you.

610
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,177
Of course not.

611
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,504
At the party,

612
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:42,744
these two men quietly left around ten o'clock,

613
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:46,073
and they didn't return until dawn.

614
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:50,074
I see.
And in that time they killed and moved Fujisawa.

615
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:02,102
They placed the shoes on the other ledge, and
put the body in the back alley.

616
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:08,062
Then they went to Fujisawa's home
and placed the supposed suicide note.

617
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,994
Isn't that right?

618
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,066
This has all been a big misunderstanding.

619
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:16,053
I had no idea about any plot Fujisawa-san
had against the company.

620
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:18,986
Stop with all these lies!

621
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:24,224
You knew all about his plans...

622
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,419
Because I'm the one that told you.

623
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:32,166
As I thought, Fujisawa-san was betrayed

624
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,236
by you, Chiho-san.

625
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:42,157
Why? Because you wanted to protect your fiancee?

626
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,200
I did it because I loved him.

627
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:59,009
I never forgot Fujisawa.

628
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,063
- Chiho?
- Sorry.

629
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:10,154
When I accepted your proposal...
I was lonely.

630
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,224
That's all it was.

631
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:20,229
When Fujisawa-san came back to the head office,
I was so happy.

632
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,003
I'm going to split up with Ryoichi-san.

633
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:30,190
So... do you want to try again?

634
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:36,260
No, get married.
Have a happy life.

635
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:41,135
I'll do everything I can to save the company.

636
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,330
"Save the company"...
in what way?

637
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,209
To uncover the fraud.

638
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:54,550
He was completely focused on the company.

639
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,558
If he failed...
The corruption in the company was
the sort of thing you didn't even talk about.

640
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:04,675
Was it really that important?

641
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:06,745
Maybe, I'd have been killed too.

642
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,700
I was such a fool.

643
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:15,721
I guess so.

644
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:23,708
But when people fall in love they do
foolish things.

645
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:30,923
As for you two, please accompany me to the station.

646
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,712
Let's go.

647
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,528
Tannai. Excellent work.

648
00:46:57,598 --> 00:47:00,548
You wrapped up this case in barely half a day.

649
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:03,701
That's Tannai-san for you!

650
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:07,021
Well, it's all down to many years' experience,
right?

651
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,527
Tsukiko, love!
What a great result!

652
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:18,469
From the start you knew it wasn't suicide
as you explained in that email.

653
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:20,484
It was nothing, really.

654
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:22,637
I could hardly call this nothing.

655
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:25,707
Ha ha ha.

656
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:34,532
It's a shame, though.
Masakado had nothing to do with the case.

657
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:38,452
Nothing?
It was very important.

658
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,489
Do you think that Bellflower pollen was chance?

659
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,528
If you hadn't found that,
I would never have been able to discover the truth.

660
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:46,661
Ah.

661
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:49,169
Sorry for suspecting the curse, though.

662
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:55,718
With this case, we have learned the truth about
Masakado.

663
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,863
It was a pretty weird case, though.

664
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:08,916
Weird things happen all the time.

665
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,919
It's just that people usually don't notice.

666
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,022
- So, let's go a grab something to eat.
- Huh?

667
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,280
- It's lunchtime.
- Off you go then.

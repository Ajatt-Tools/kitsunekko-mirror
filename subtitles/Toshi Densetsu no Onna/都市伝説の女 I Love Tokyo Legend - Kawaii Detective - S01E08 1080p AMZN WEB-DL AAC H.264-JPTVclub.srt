1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,954
Shibuya,
Shinjuku and
Ginza.

2
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:09,218
Three places.
Three cases of murder.

3
00:00:09,304 --> 00:00:13,192
And for some unknown reason
each victim was a fortune-teller.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:17,193
So, on this moonlit night...

5
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:20,183
(chanting)

6
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:04,745
Sensei!
Are you okay?

7
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,176
Sensei?!

8
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,244
Sensei!

9
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,230
Sensei...!

10
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
I called the police.
Are you okay?

11
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,223
- I'm beat.
- Too right. Let's go back.

12
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,493
What's that?

13
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:24,343
- A man?
- I don't know.

14
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:31,352
- What is it?
- What could it be?

15
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:41,244
That person...

16
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:45,314
Er, excuse me?

17
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,974
We still can't find this man.

18
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:57,944
An important witness to the serial murders.

19
00:01:58,014 --> 00:01:59,963
A man like that won't let himself be found.

20
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,982
Ah, I sick of looking for this guy.

21
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,967
Tonight let's all go for a drink!

22
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:06,019
- Katsushige, you can come too.
- It's Katsuura.

23
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,988
- Great idea.
- Are you buying?

24
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,336
- What?
- In that case, I'll come too.

25
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:11,958
I'm not treating anyone.

26
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,944
If you want to increase your chances
of getting rich...

27
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,030
- Tonight is the night to do it.
- Really?

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,917
When it's a full moon, if you hold out your wallet
to the moon and shake it...

29
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:23,937
it'll bring you luck.
So the saying goes.

30
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,989
- A wallet?
And just shake it?
- Yes.

31
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:29,025
- Shibayama!
Stop that!
- Ah... sorry.

32
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:32,896
- Less of this nonsense!
- But you were all doing it...

33
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:38,001
- Although maybe I should try it?
- Tannai-san?

34
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,921
I'm having trouble paying the mortgage this month.

35
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:45,992
So, everyone, take your wallet and
take out anything that isn't money.

36
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,945
Receipts and that sort of thing.

37
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,947
Coupons, too?
How about a Point Card?

38
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,049
Nope, no good.

39
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,019
Okay?

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,169
Then what do we do.

41
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:03,944
Tonight is a full moon.
I get the feeling something going to happen.

42
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,979
What kind of thing?

43
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,965
Tsukiko, do you have a moment?

44
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:12,035
Could it be...
Another fortune teller?

45
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:15,105
There's been a fourth attack.

46
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,962
Goda Chihiro-san.
You've been a fortune teller for seven years?

47
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:24,948
Yes. I was chanting a spell in here

48
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:29,035
- when I was attacked.
- A spell?

49
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:33,907
When you use characters like stars in a circle
you can create a space...

50
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,926
Where you can summon devils, or purify the place,

51
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,995
for example.

52
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,068
Chihiro-san, use this.

53
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,919
Thank you.

54
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,954
He's one of your followers?

55
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:52,959
No, he isn't a follower.

56
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,962
My name is Tozaki.
I own this building.

57
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,950
I live on the floor above with Chihiro-san.

58
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,936
Oh, I see.

59
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:06,923
This is the second floor, and the criminal
came in from the balcony.

60
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:11,961
And when he escaped, he jumped from here too.

61
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:13,356
Akiyama?

62
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:15,081
What's this?

63
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:18,151
- Put your hat straight!
- Leave it!

64
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,922
- It's hair.
- Well, I can see that.

65
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,975
Do you have a dog or a cat as a pet?

66
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:28,962
No.

67
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:32,982
Perhaps it came from the beast?

68
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:35,969
In fact, in the three other locations

69
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,055
some kind of fur was found at the scene.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,125
- Some kind of fur?
- Yes. Some kind of fur.

71
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,927
A beast...

72
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,981
I knew I'd be next.

73
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:50,083
What?

74
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:52,153
Why do you say that?

75
00:04:55,008 --> 00:05:00,994
The three victims taught me how to be
a fortune teller.

76
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,963
In March, Yu Abe-san was murdered.

77
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,950
In April, it was Ogawa Itadaka-san.

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,968
In May, Isaki Ten-san.

79
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,987
- Their first names spell out
"ecstatic"!
- So they do!

80
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:14,958
I also believed the fourth attack would be tonight.

81
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:19,913
I had a feeling that something
dangerous would happen.

82
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,915
This much is clear.

83
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:26,002
Also, these cases have one important
thing in common.

84
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:27,921
Which is?

85
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:30,974
Wow... a police officer

86
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,944
who notices these kinds of things.

87
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:39,949
I'm a little different from your usual policeman.

88
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,928
Hang on.

89
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,053
Why do you think tonight is more dangerous?

90
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:46,923
And what's this thing they have in common?

91
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,926
Abe Yu was killed on March 8th.

92
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:52,979
Ogawa Itadaka-san, died April 7th.

93
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,049
Isaki Ten-san, May 6th.

94
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,885
And the fourth victim

95
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:03,039
Goda Chihiro-san, was attacked tonight.

96
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,109
And so?

97
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:10,914
On each of these nights, there was a full moon.

98
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,985
The moon's influence is strongest on those days.

99
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:21,991
Nervousness increase and heart
rate rises, so they say

100
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,055
Isn't that just coincidence?

101
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:25,979
Coincidence?
No.

102
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:30,984
You've heard that there are more births just
before or after a full moon?

103
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:35,972
The full moon and the new moon are when stocks
are at their lowest and highest.

104
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,957
But all these are just chance...

105
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:41,978
The hormone balance can be affected, and
feelings of aggression increase.

106
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:46,950
It is said that murder, suicide and arson
all increase.

107
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,952
Why are you saying this?

108
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:53,039
Do you mean the serial killer is under the
influence of the full moon?

109
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:56,025
- That can't be...
- That's exactly what I mean.

110
00:06:56,095 --> 00:07:04,095
The power of the moon is causing these
murders. No doubt about it.

111
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,939
Has this man been seen in the area again?

112
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,975
Yes.

113
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:13,993
Are you absolutely sure it was this man?

114
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,896
We've spoken to him before, so we're certain.

115
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,032
And he disappeared with amazing speed.

116
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:20,552
Amazing speed?

117
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,152
That man?

118
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,907
Full moon... some kind of fur...
a beast...
agile movement...

119
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,945
- There can only be one conclusion?
- Conclusion?

120
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:36,950
No, but really.
It's a little...

121
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,968
Otonashi.
Just say it.

122
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,988
This could be

123
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:45,058
I'm not certain.
I'm just talking about the possibility.

124
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:48,128
For the last time, what is it, Tsukiko-san?

125
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:55,201
It's the work of the Wolf Man.

126
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,263
Aaaaagh!

127
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:01,007
I'm off.

128
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:03,077
- Let's go, Watanabe.
- Sir.

129
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:20,081
Subs: ersby

130
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,070
raws: furransu

131
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,950
Okay.

132
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,519
At least put it straight.

133
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,021
Huh? Otonashi?

134
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:51,924
Well, since she knows about fortune telling,
I wondered if I could borrow her.

135
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:54,961
That's great!
I mean...
fine by me.

136
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,996
Listen up, everyone!

137
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:01,968
From today, Otonashi will be assigned
to Gohara's team.

138
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:03,970
Otonashi?!

139
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,939
If Gohara-san insists he needs her...

140
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,992
I'm in no position to refuse.

141
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:12,945
- Otonashi, sorry to see you go.
- It can't be helped, though.

142
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:18,951
But...
I'll need the rest of you to help the investigation.

143
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,037
Of course.
We'll do anything.

144
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,043
- Right, Watanabe-san?
- Thank you for your help.

145
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:30,013
These are the three victims.

146
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:34,884
And the fortune teller attacked last night,
Goda Chihiro-san, was trained by them.

147
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:37,920
Chihiro-san and her lover,
Tozaki, live together in that building.

148
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,974
Also, at the scene of the crime, witnesses
saw this man again.

149
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:46,979
We still don't know his name but he's definitely
the most important piece of this puzzle.

150
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,981
He never told us his name when I asked.

151
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,935
How often have you met him?

152
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:56,989
First, we spoke at the shrine to Masakado.

153
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,992
Next, was at the village of the Tengu.

154
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:01,944
Right.
That's where I've seen him before.

155
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:07,016
You guys keep meeting this suspected murderer, and
not one of you gets his name.
That's typical of you, Tannai-san.

156
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,985
- Oi, Shibayama.
- And you, Gohara-san?

157
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,953
What clues have you found?

158
00:10:11,023 --> 00:10:14,974
This man is an acquaintance of Tozaki,
we know that.

159
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,993
An acquaintance?

160
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:18,995
These three people

161
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,948
were involved in some pretty shady business.

162
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:25,635
You say your wife was hurt by some psychics?

163
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:28,004
Ha.
By those three.

164
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,039
The victims?
She used to visit them?

165
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:34,109
There were things going on behind the scenes.

166
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:37,964
The first one took a precious jewel from her.

167
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:44,036
Although she thought it odd and complained,
the second one brainwashed her, and

168
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:46,022
she signed away her house and car.

169
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:48,958
The third made her put his wife's debt in her name.

170
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,911
- And so you formed a victim support group?
- I'm the chairman.

171
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:57,934
Everything my wife did was
supposedly of her own free will so, you see,
we can't prove they are doing any harm.

172
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:01,921
So you know this man?

173
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:05,041
He did a talk at a meeting, yes.

174
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,910
He spoke about fraudulent psychics

175
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,947
and he told us how we could defeat them.

176
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,984
- Do you know his name?
- Hmm, let's see...

177
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:17,954
I cannot forgive these nasty little criminals

178
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,890
I'm a busybody.

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,925
- Is all called himself.
- Well, well, well.

180
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:25,978
"Well, well, well"?

181
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,047
How's your wife now?

182
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:31,951
She's totally addicted to a new fortune-teller now.

183
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:35,922
- Is that Goda Chihiro?
- Yes. My wife says

184
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:42,028
that Chihiro-san is different from the
other three. She really gets messages from God

185
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:46,098
I don't think she'll ever learn.

186
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:51,954
The vice chairman of the support group
is doing the same thing.

187
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,941
He's giving her a place to live.

188
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:58,010
The vice-chairman is Tozaki-san?

189
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,012
That guy's from a family of landowners.

190
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:03,065
Those three fortune tellers really stole a lot

191
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:07,135
but even he fell for Chihiro's charms.

192
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,923
I have to be somewhere.

193
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,960
Ah, just one more thing.

194
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,129
Where were you at eight o'clock last night?

195
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,199
Eight o'clock...?

196
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,936
I was at a support group meeting.

197
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,005
How many people were there with you?

198
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,941
Including Tozaki-san, about ten.

199
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,894
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

200
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,948
Do you think Chihiro-san and Tozaki-san
are really lovers?

201
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:37,148
I don't know.

202
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:40,937
He's been tricked by fortune tellers, and

203
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:47,093
became the vice chairman of the victim support
group so why live with another fortune teller?

204
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,951
The moon's phases take about twenty nine
and a half days to complete.

205
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,937
From the full moon, it'll slowly
start disappearing.

206
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:00,990
Only Tsukiko-san could make the moon's
phases seem interesting.

207
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,977
When the moon can no longer be seen,
that's a new moon.

208
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:07,517
If you want to start something new,

209
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:09,916
a new moon would be a good time.

210
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:12,969
I was born under a new moon.

211
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,021
Is that why you're called Tsukiko?

212
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:18,958
And there were no stars in the sky. It must've
been a quiet night.

213
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:22,945
Maybe Tsukiko-san is the reincarnation
of Princess Kaguya.

214
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:26,065
Maybe they'll come and take me back to the moon.

215
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,135
That would be bad.
Really bad.

216
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,123
Katsuura, look!

217
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,098
- Katsuura, after him!
- Right!

218
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,122
Please wait!

219
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,078
You're kidding...!

220
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,002
He cut it with a cane?

221
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,975
I'll call for back up.

222
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:10,960
Don't bother, Katsuura.

223
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,849
Look at him.

224
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,933
He's no ordinary man.

225
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:20,102
He might not be a man at all.

226
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:22,254
Then what?

227
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,324
He may be the Wolf Man.

228
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:31,113
Fake psychics make him angry, so he's
punishing them himself.

229
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:33,115
Well...

230
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,184
Are you being serious?

231
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:39,155
I also thought I was crazy, but it must be him.

232
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,174
It's only on a full moon that he
has the power to transform.

233
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,109
And so...

234
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,196
There's no such thing as a Wolf Man.

235
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,166
People have seen him for generations.

236
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,118
- She's off again.
- In Europe during the Dark Ages...

237
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:57,173
Rebels were banished into the woods
by the authorities...

238
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:02,161
But at night people were still attacked, and
that's when the werewolf legend began.

239
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:05,114
So it was just thieves.

240
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:11,187
During a full moon, when there was more light
criminals could do their work much more easily.
But...

241
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:16,158
there's also the theory that the full moon can
drive people wild.

242
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:20,145
Seriously, I can't take this any more!

243
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:25,117
Thanks to your generosity, Gohara,

244
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:30,122
this woman's unacceptable nonsense

245
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:34,159
will be taken away.

246
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:38,197
- Well, I didn't say I'd-
- So, this Wolf man...

247
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,165
Gohara-san,
please continue with your regular investigation.

248
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,167
But, the thing is...

249
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:45,087
The battle will be during the next full moon.

250
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:48,344
Until then, I shall be doing my own investigation.

251
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,344
That's all!

252
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,220
It's late.

253
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,290
A beautiful moon, though.

254
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:13,132
As you may know

255
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:17,319
my subordinates are looking for you.

256
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:21,389
Hmm... so it seems.

257
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:25,311
You should lie low for a while.

258
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,300
It'll soon be time to say farewell.
To Tsukiko-san, too.

259
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:47,186
Yes. We think he intends to try again at
the next full moon.

260
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,255
Excuse me.

261
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,325
Here you are.

262
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,128
Tozaki-san,

263
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,217
Did you ever meet the three fortune tellers?

264
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:08,087
He's quite a weak man.

265
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:13,158
There are many who cannot live without
someone to lead them.

266
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:17,129
I seem to attract those kinds of people.

267
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,166
Well, are you a fraud like your teachers?

268
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:23,185
- Fraud?
- Like, for example,

269
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,137
Property theft.

270
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,209
I don't do this for money.

271
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:34,279
You don't need money once you know where to get it.

272
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:37,349
What do you mean by that?

273
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,291
It's a secret.

274
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:47,159
If your belief is weak

275
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:50,145
you'll be easily deceived.

276
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:56,201
I've never tried to fool anyone for material gain,
myself.

277
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:57,484
In other words...

278
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:01,123
Tozaki-san lets you stay here of his own free will.

279
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,158
That's right.

280
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,178
Sounds fishy to me.

281
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:10,182
Well, shall we take a look into your future.

282
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,252
- Eh?
- Let's do it.

283
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,322
Place your hand here.

284
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:20,341
You know, I don't believe in this kind of thing.

285
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,023
I see a drowning.

286
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:28,150
Be careful around water.

287
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,219
A drowning?
Makes no sense...

288
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:35,124
- And I see you are in love.
- What?

289
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:40,195
With a very pretty colleague, right?

290
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:44,149
Amazing!
Spot on!
How did you know.

291
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:47,152
That's not really so amazing.

292
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,154
Being in love is hardly rare.

293
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:52,257
And if they reply
"but I'm not in love."

294
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:53,782
You can just say...

295
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,377
"You'll meet someone soon."

296
00:18:57,332 --> 00:19:01,332
Now, let me tell your fortune.

297
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:12,311
What's this?

298
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:19,151
Did you see something scary as a child?

299
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:22,171
She saw a Tengu when she was five.

300
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,307
- Quiet, Katsuura.
- Sorry.

301
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:29,377
I see.
There's something odd about it,
like you were caught.

302
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:33,115
Can you see anything else?

303
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:36,235
- Your future.
- Future?

304
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,223
Like who she'll marry?

305
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,257
This is...

306
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:45,327
What can you see, Chihiro-san?

307
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:53,569
What can you see, Chihiro-san?

308
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,610
It's not really working today.

309
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:08,531
In that case, let me try.

310
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,601
Chihiro-san, I shall tell your fortune.

311
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,595
It's no use.

312
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:28,384
Tonight there's a new moon.

313
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:32,572
When the influence of the moon is the
same as when it is full.

314
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:35,642
A day when the spirit becomes strong.

315
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:37,412
Hm. Ah.

316
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:39,445
I see something.

317
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:41,414
You are crying.

318
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:44,601
That's one of the clichés of fortune telling.

319
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,764
You're crying with someone.

320
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:49,721
Your mother?

321
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,840
No, she seems older.

322
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:55,626
Your grandmother.

323
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,617
Is that right, Chihiro-san?

324
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,553
This is absurd.

325
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:06,123
Running away?

326
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:10,126
You don't want me to know about your past?

327
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:15,931
Your bluff almost worked.

328
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,968
You should quit the police, do this full time.

329
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,955
Unfortunately,

330
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:28,043
I'm a police officer because I'm on a mission to
find a genuine urban myth.

331
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:31,913
Is this a joke?

332
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:39,905
You're a funny one.

333
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:43,092
If you ever get fired, why not join me?

334
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:45,162
We'd make a great team.

335
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,983
Did you really see all that, Tsukiko-san?

336
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,007
Of course.

337
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,103
It was a bluff.

338
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:59,174
But... hm...

339
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,115
Tozaki-san? Tozaki-san!

340
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,918
Are you okay?

341
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,953
I'm fine. Sorry.

342
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:12,955
Really, I'm fine.

343
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,990
Thanks.

344
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,042
My body's always been weak.

345
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:19,945
- So, you tried fortune telling...?
- Yes, Chihiro-san.

346
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:22,915
She saw me going to the future with a strong aura.

347
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:28,020
Apart from the property left by my parents
I have nothing.

348
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,956
I can't do anything for myself.

349
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:34,043
Now I'm happy, thanks to Chihiro-san.

350
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:37,113
But, do you think it's suspicious?

351
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:41,033
- Sorry!
- Stop! Stop!

352
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:43,103
Ah, sorry!

353
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,941
Ah, it's just as Chihiro-san said!

354
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,926
I see a drowning.

355
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,895
Be careful around water.

356
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:56,982
You see? She's right.
She's the real thing.

357
00:22:57,052 --> 00:23:00,953
- I see.
- Do you want to know more about her?

358
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:03,939
She can give you a bright future.

359
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,009
- A bright future?
- Yes.

360
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,945
Like, your love becoming true?

361
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,947
- That would be easy for her.
- Wow.

362
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,882
I'll just have a quick word.

363
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:16,986
Katsuura, what's got into you?

364
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:19,939
Sorry, but she was right about the water.

365
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,891
Isn't saying that going to lead to more victims
of fraud?

366
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,960
No, not victims-

367
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,948
You're the vice-chairman of a support group.

368
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:31,951
I'm going to leave that group.

369
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,937
That night, I told Matoba-san.

370
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,956
That night?

371
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,959
The night when Chihiro-san was attacked?

372
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:42,845
Yes.
So I got into an argument with Matoba-san.

373
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:45,948
You're going to live with the same person
who's deceiving us?

374
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,950
Chihiro Goda-san was a student of the other three.

375
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,935
No. She's not like them.

376
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:53,022
- She's the real thing.
- How can you say such things?!

377
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:54,957
The meeting was adjourned.

378
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,910
And there's not been one since.

379
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,047
What time did the meeting end?

380
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:05,117
A little after seven o'clock, I think.

381
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:10,071
Eight o'clock...?
I was at a support group meeting.

382
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,958
So you finished early that night?

383
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:16,045
Yes. Is that important?

384
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:18,115
Well...

385
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,481
At the time when
Chihiro-san was attacked you told us...

386
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:31,460
you were with the other group members didn't you?

387
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,396
- Yes.
- But the truth is,

388
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:36,449
that meeting ended soon after seven.

389
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,436
The other members have confirmed this.

390
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:46,475
Since this seems a bit suspicious, could you tell
us what you were doing at eight o'clock that night?

391
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:50,463
If that was when she was attacked, then

392
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:54,417
any one of us could've done it, right?

393
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:59,355
A criminal lead by the power of the moon.

394
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:01,557
- Yes.
- Otonashi.

395
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,627
Ah... Assistant Commissioner.

396
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,445
Excuse me.

397
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:10,466
Otonashi, is it true that the chairman's
alibi has been disproved?

398
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:13,519
Yes.
Gohara's questioning him now.

399
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:16,439
I've got it, Tsukiko-san.
Ah... Assistant Commissioner.

400
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:20,443
- What is it that you understand?
- Sir...

401
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:25,448
Matoba, the chairman of the support group was
in a martial arts group when he was a student.

402
00:25:25,518 --> 00:25:28,417
Even now, he still exercises.

403
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,453
We found a lot of training equipment at his place.

404
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:34,473
But if this chairman was the criminal,

405
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:39,445
then what connection do you think this man has
with the crimes?

406
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:44,483
With a fake alibi and knowledge of choking
techniques it looks like he's our man.

407
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:46,435
- But I don't think it's that simple.

408
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:51,440
You'd need specialised training to be
like the Wolf Man.

409
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,426
We're back to that...

410
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:57,530
So no ordinary human could've committed
these crimes.

411
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,600
There's still a chance that this
person is the Wolf Man.

412
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,451
I see.

413
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,439
Tricky, isn't it?

414
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,524
Ah, that reminds me...

415
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:12,594
Tannai-san, could you look into a
couple of things for me?

416
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:16,449
- Don't order me around.
- Tannai.

417
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,452
I think you should follow her instructions.

418
00:26:19,522 --> 00:26:21,520
Sir!

419
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,610
Thanks, dear.
I mean, Assistant Commissioner.

420
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:28,426
What is going on between them?

421
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:34,519
- Gohara-san.
- Ah, Tsukiko.

422
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,840
- How is interrogation going?
- Ah... that...

423
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,892
He just won't confess.

424
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:44,831
And we can't make an arrest, because there's
no physical evidence, linking him to the crime.

425
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,833
- Well, well, well...
- "Well, well...?"

426
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:50,887
Gohara-san, why don't you come back to my place?

427
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,839
- Your place?
- Yep.

428
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,774
- Why would he do that?
- I'll go.

429
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:56,843
You.
Keep your mouth shut.

430
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:59,846
(doorbell)

431
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:03,833
- Hello?
- It's Gohara.

432
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:07,873
Sorry, I was a bit sweaty, so I
'm just out of the shower.

433
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:12,925
- I see...
- Just let yourself in.

434
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:13,933
Okay.

435
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:15,746
Excuse me.

436
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,491
This is a nice place.

437
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,593
Excuse me.

438
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,629
Welcome.

439
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,497
I thought she lived alone...

440
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:37,533
Pleased to meet you.
I'm her sister, Miyako.

441
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:40,553
Ah, don't worry.
I just have a little infection.

442
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:43,539
He's the ace of the investigation team, Gohara-san.

443
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:46,492
Wow, the ace?
Amazing.

444
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:48,511
It's not, really.

445
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:50,530
Hello, Gohara-san.

446
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,650
What...
why...
you...?

447
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
I could ask you the same.

448
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:59,522
Since the next full moon will be soon

449
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,507
this is a council of war.

450
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:05,428
This room will be the headquarters of the
second investigation.

451
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,378
That's why we're here?

452
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,515
Please take a seat.

453
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,517
Do you always come here?

454
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:14,537
No.. not always...

455
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:16,606
Don't worry about that, Miyako.
I'll take care of it.

456
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:18,524
Okay.

457
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:22,478
Katsuura has some new information to tell us.

458
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:26,432
That's right.
It's about the hair found at the crime scene.

459
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,501
And it came from a wolf?

460
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:31,521
Nope. From a mink.

461
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,539
Mink?

462
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,526
Yeah, like you'd find on an ordinary jacket.

463
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:38,544
Not a wolf?

464
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:41,547
The hair found at each crime scene were all mink.

465
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:43,533
How strange...

466
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:46,586
- Are you sure?
- After I saw this...

467
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:49,522
I checked the four crime scenes again.

468
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:52,525
None had evidence of forced entry.

469
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:54,577
If I was possessed by the moon

470
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,612
I'd just smash my way into places.

471
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:58,431
You're right.

472
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:01,467
Certainly, it means there was never any Wolf Man.

473
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:02,437
Wrong.

474
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,237
We can't be so sure.

475
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,556
We'll know after the next full moon.

476
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:09,525
Gohara-san, you'll help us, right?

477
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:13,616
- With what?
- Luring the Wolf Man.

478
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,200
"So,

479
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:23,188
on the night of the full moon,

480
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:23,157
the curtain opens on

481
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:23,142
a fearful tragic scene..."

482
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:28,911
He'll appear again?

483
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:31,981
Because there's a full moon tonight.

484
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:37,820
But, perhaps he's given up?

485
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,839
Why do you say that?

486
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,943
A man who kills when there's a full moon

487
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:47,013
won't give up after his first failure.

488
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,784
But didn't you catch the chairman of
the victim support group?

489
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:53,853
That Matoba fellow.

490
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:56,922
He was part of the investigation, but
he was never arrested.

491
00:29:56,992 --> 00:30:00,893
He has no alibi but also
there's no evidence linking him to the crime.

492
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:02,963
- And also...
- Also?

493
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:07,833
Matoba-san doesn't seem the type.

494
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:09,835
Type?

495
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:11,035
How can I say...

496
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:14,824
he not easily influenced by
things like fortune tellers.

497
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:16,826
That type.

498
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:20,632
If you can be manipulated by
the Moon's mysterious power and...

499
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:22,598
given strength greater than your own

500
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:26,668
that indicates something darker hidden inside.

501
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,640
The Wolf Man will definitely appear.

502
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,710
If he didn't, it would be strange.

503
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,630
He really wanted you dead

504
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,700
then he'll certainly try again tonight.

505
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:49,708
Don't you agree, Chihiro-san?

506
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,629
Yes.

507
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:58,699
So tonight, I'll be your decoy.

508
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,540
Is this really necessary?

509
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,543
The killer's already murdered three people.

510
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:09,579
- If you're under threat, shoot him.
- Sir.

511
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,548
Tsukiko-san, I've made the things you wanted.

512
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:14,517
- Ah.
- What's that?

513
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:17,520
Bullets with a silver coating.

514
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,590
Aren't they supposed to be solid silver?

515
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,625
Well, I was on a tight schedule.

516
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:24,544
I guessed something silver would do.

517
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,479
Tsukiko-san, what are these?

518
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:31,218
You can only kill a werewolf with a silver bullet.
So they say...

519
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,553
You must have heard about this.

520
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:35,521
- I've seen it in films.
- Yes, films.

521
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:37,490
The story of silver bullets

522
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,545
first appeared in the early cinema.

523
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:45,548
But there may be some truth in it

524
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:47,483
according to Haruki.

525
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:49,139
Haruki?
Who's that?

526
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,570
A secret.

527
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,609
Here's one for each of you.

528
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:01,564
If the Wolf Man appears, please use this bullet.

529
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:04,617
- It'll be 3000 yen per bullet.
- How much?

530
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,687
Aren't they usually 30 yen each?

531
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:18,497
Woah, dresses really suit her.
She's looking good.

532
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,654
When I'm in the circle, try
to keep your voice down.

533
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:25,538
Magic to summon the devil

534
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:29,525
becomes a door to another world,
so you mustn't speak.

535
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:32,528
- Devil.
- Yes.

536
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:34,513
I cast a spell in this.

537
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,483
To make a deal with the devil.

538
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:41,470
If someone weak summons the devil without
good reason...

539
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
it can get serious.

540
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:58,073
(chanting)

541
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:05,928
- Do you think he'll really come?
- Well...

542
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:08,030
If he comes, we'll do as she said.

543
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Sir.

544
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:38,043
(sound of the wind)

545
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:40,113
(growling)

546
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:46,054
- The Wolf Man!
- He's here!

547
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:51,141
Tsukiko-san, run!

548
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:59,065
How did he do that?

549
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,323
Katsuura!

550
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,193
Do something!

551
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:14,099
Throw him off!

552
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:23,038
Get your hands off him!

553
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:25,108
If you don't, I'll shoot!

554
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:28,145
I'll really shoot!

555
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:32,115
Last warning!

556
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,906
That was...

557
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:36,469
Gunshots!
 You stay here.

558
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,839
Sir.

559
00:34:39,308 --> 00:34:41,308
.
(Bullit in Wall)

560
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,809
I can't believe you missed from there.
(At Arrow Point)

561
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:46,879
That... was just a warning shot.

562
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,949
Liar.

563
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:51,934
Police!

564
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:54,004
Hands up!

565
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:56,822
Careful!
I'm in pursuit!

566
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:58,757
Are you okay, Katsuura?

567
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,826
Tsukiko-san, I saw his face.

568
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:02,845
Huh?

569
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:06,885
The Wolf Man's face.
And it's just as you expected.

570
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:23,832
Woah...
what's that?!

571
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:28,298
If you're at a T-junction when there's
a full moon, and you make a wish...

572
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,923
that wish'll come true, Tsukiko-san says.

573
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:35,844
And shake your wallet at it and
you'll be lucky with money.

574
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:37,780
- Have you taken the receipts out?
- Coupons?

575
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,916
- Point card?
- I only leave cash in there.

576
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:42,986
Let's try it.

577
00:35:45,908 --> 00:35:48,410
- What's that?
- What the hell are you guys doing?!

578
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,809
Watanabe-san, what's going on?

579
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:54,049
What does it look like? I'm
chasing a werewolf!

580
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:57,449
The suspect has just passed the T-junction.

581
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,291
Come quietly!

582
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,406
I think we got him!

583
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:25,347
- What was that?!
- Who is this guy?

584
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,377
Huh?

585
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:49,385
It's fine, it's fine.
I'll do it.

586
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,410
You?

587
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:02,415
Tozaki-san.

588
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,325
Where did that strength come from?

589
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:15,395
Excuse me.

590
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,335
As I thought.

591
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:25,237
I see now.

592
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:29,324
The person who gave this man such power.

593
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,394
Eh?

594
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,584
I'm not really sure

595
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:40,786
why I'm here.

596
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:43,272
- Of course not.
- What do you mean?

597
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,474
This case

598
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:49,495
seemed to be a case of a Wolf Man attacking during
a full moon.

599
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:53,165
But I was wrong.

600
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:56,286
Thanks.
I got it.

601
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:58,987
It's just been confirmed.

602
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:03,075
The fur from the pendant and the fur from each
crime scene is a perfect match.

603
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:05,026
You were the criminal, Tozaki-san.

604
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:11,116
But the person who gave you the power
of the full moon

605
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:16,186
and made you a killer, well, that was someone else.

606
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:19,209
Right?
Chihiro-san.

607
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,180
Otonashi.

608
00:38:27,002 --> 00:38:29,925
- I figured it out. 
- I thought you would.
- Figured what out?

609
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,650
Chihiro Goda.

610
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,090
Real name,
Tanaka Hiroko.

611
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,096
You lost both your parents while you
were a schoolchild.

612
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:45,166
They committed suicide together at Mount Fuji.

613
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:51,139
Your father had been tricked by
those three fortune tellers.

614
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:57,209
He lost his business and his house.

615
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:04,119
And when the grandmother you lived
with after that died

616
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:09,189
You had to survive on your own.

617
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:14,029
You were also one of their victims.

618
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,114
So, at that time...

619
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:20,184
You're crying with someone.
Your mother?

620
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,121
No, she seems older.

621
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,025
Your grandmother.

622
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,044
This is absurd.

623
00:39:29,114 --> 00:39:33,083
I recognised that you were just trying
to hide your feelings.

624
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,986
So we looked into your past.

625
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:41,072
Amazing, Tsukiko-san.
Your bluff became a hit.

626
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:47,028
In order to get revenge, you became
close to the three fortune tellers.

627
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:49,030
Became a disciple.

628
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,102
Then you met a man who was susceptible
to your influence.

629
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,038
- Susceptible.
- Please look at this man.

630
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:59,975
His physical condition is usually much worse.

631
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:04,079
And he doesn't look like the kind that
could kill a man.

632
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:06,014
So what if he did?

633
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,983
Usually people...

634
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:12,070
only use about a fifth of the strength
they are capable of.

635
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,025
Only occasionaly are we able to demonstrate
100% of our strength.

636
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:20,028
It's called the Fight or Flight response.

637
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:22,030
Fight or Flight...

638
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,934
Recently in America a 15-year-old boy from Michigan

639
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:28,970
lifted a 900kg car

640
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,039
That his grandfather was trapped under.

641
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,024
This was reported widely.

642
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:37,112
Why was this boy able to achieve this?

643
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:39,014
No one really knows.

644
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:40,982
And this guy did the same?

645
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:46,087
These sorts of things are once in a lifetime events

646
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:51,079
but Chihiro-san was about to make him believe
he could do it often.

647
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:57,048
Because the full moon is said to increase
a body's ability.

648
00:40:57,118 --> 00:41:00,188
It was an excellent trigger for the trance.

649
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:07,174
Chihiro-san went to the home of the
victim in advance

650
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:15,166
And unlocked a window to make it easier
to break in.

651
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:34,019
So that no one suspected you, you arranged
for yourself to be attacked.

652
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:39,007
You made sure there'd be people in the next room.

653
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:43,111
Then, as you became scared that I was
getting close to the truth

654
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:47,181
tonight, you made him attack me, too.

655
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:55,141
So what happens now?

656
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:04,198
Can you prove any of this?

657
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:11,356
Can you prove any of this?

658
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:15,329
You know, there is a way.

659
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:19,763
We can let the court decide.

660
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:24,852
When I was here this afternoon, I left this behind.

661
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,922
Well, goodbye.

662
00:42:34,815 --> 00:42:38,849
"Tozaki...
tonight there'll be a full moon."

663
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:43,919
"You will be helpless against the
hatred boiling inside you."

664
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:49,909
You will kill the detective called
Otonashi Tsukiko.

665
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:55,915
You will kill the detective called
Otonashi Tsukiko.

666
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:13,916
I've had this bad feeling

667
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:17,755
ever since I met you.

668
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:21,809
Of course.
You were predicting your own future.

669
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,761
I don't have any powers like that.

670
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:28,766
That whole fortune telling thing was fake.

671
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:30,784
Eh?

672
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:34,755
All that talk about mysterious forces
was just acting.

673
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:36,840
You mean...

674
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,910
My hypnosis only increased what was already there.

675
00:43:41,815 --> 00:43:45,833
You really did hate those three fortune tellers.

676
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,903
And me, too.

677
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,856
Your hatred for people

678
00:43:52,926 --> 00:43:56,926
became an ability to understand their thoughts.

679
00:43:57,848 --> 00:44:03,734
I was quite proud I could tell what people
thought just by their expressions.

680
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:08,722
When someone wanted to tell me something,
I could just read their face.

681
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:15,813
So, you used the power of the moon
and your fortune telling

682
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:17,883
to bring about your revenge.

683
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:23,854
I was amazed that someone who was so susceptible...

684
00:44:23,924 --> 00:44:25,924
really exists.

685
00:44:26,977 --> 00:44:31,977
But Tozaki really believed in you.

686
00:44:34,885 --> 00:44:38,885
You saw that as a weakness and exploited it.

687
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:46,928
In the end

688
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:55,853
Those three hateful fortune tellers

689
00:44:55,923 --> 00:45:00,923
were no different... to me.

690
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,762
It's a shame.

691
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:06,814
You could have

692
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:12,884
really helped people.

693
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:18,944
Let's go back to the station.

694
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:30,771
I'm a fake, so you don't have to believe me...

695
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,806
Hm?

696
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:36,240
That time when I was looking into the crystal ball...

697
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:37,761
I saw something.

698
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:39,830
Eh?

699
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,900
About your future...

700
00:45:42,903 --> 00:45:44,868
This is...?

701
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:46,938
Er, what did you see?

702
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,909
Take care.

703
00:45:51,912 --> 00:45:54,898
Because...

704
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:58,098
you'll be dead within a week.

705
00:45:59,002 --> 00:46:01,002
Huh?

706
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,773
You're sick!
Don't mess with us!

707
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:08,815
On top of everything, we've got
threatening a police officer.

708
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:11,330
I may be a fake,

709
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,981
but that's my prediction.

710
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:20,754
We'll look after you, won't
we? Guys?

711
00:46:20,824 --> 00:46:22,840
Sure.

712
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,910
Everyone will protect you.
You'll be fine.

713
00:46:30,818 --> 00:46:33,700
- Otonashi's a good cop, right?
- Yep.

714
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,753
You'll grow to like her charms.

715
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:38,789
So from this day on, she'll be part of your team.

716
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:40,758
- That's great, isn't it.
- Right.

717
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:42,726
Thanks but no thanks.

718
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:44,862
She doesn't really fit in with the
rest of the team.

719
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,932
- But, I think th-
- I'll leave her with you.

720
00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:50,834
Damn.
Failed.

721
00:46:50,904 --> 00:46:52,904
- Let's go.
- Sir.

722
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:56,991
So we never found out the name of the
man in the police sketch.

723
00:46:57,828 --> 00:46:59,843
Tsukiko-san?

724
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:02,913
You believe that fortune teller!

725
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:08,884
So I'll die within a week...?

726
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:16,760
I've decided that I may stay here a little longer.

727
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,812
That's good.

728
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:22,819
Now you're not a suspected serial killer.

729
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:28,922
Perhaps another week here.

730
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,927
A week?

731
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:36,780
A week where I can

732
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,853
be close to Tsukiko-san.

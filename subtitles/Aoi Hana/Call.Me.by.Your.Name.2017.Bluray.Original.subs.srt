2
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,172
The usurper.

3
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,426
Caro? He's here.

4
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,199
- Professor Perlman.
- Welcome, welcome.

5
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,368
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, my goodness.

6
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,911
You're bigger than your picture.

7
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,496
Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.

8
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,331
That's the problem.

9
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,333
He seems very confident.

10
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,794
- Mrs. Perlman.
- Annella.

11
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,253
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.

12
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,755
- Thank you for having me in your home.
- Welcome.

13
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,090
Where's Elio?

14
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,633
I'll go down.

15
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,967
Elio?

16
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,262
- You must be exhausted.
- What gave me away?

17
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Hey.

18
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,486
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

19
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,987
- He's already here?
- Yes!

20
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,199
Every single one of these will.

21
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,201
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

22
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,036
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you. Elio.

23
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,830
You must be exhausted.

24
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,040
- A little bit.
- Come, come, come.

25
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,875
May I bring your things up to your room?

26
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,044
- Sure. Yeah.
- My room?

27
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,090
Follow him.

28
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,342
- You're very welcome here.
- Si.

29
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,386
Our home is your home.

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,935
You're leaving?

31
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,063
- Hello.
- Hi.

32
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,023
Nice to meet you.

33
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,677
My room is now your room.

34
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,596
I'll be next door.

35
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,894
We have to share the bathroom.

36
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,104
It's my only way out.

37
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,157
We're being called for dinner.

38
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,742
Sorry.

39
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,412
Yeah.

40
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,289
We're being called for dinner.

41
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,834
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

42
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,587
Will you make an excuse for me
to your mom, though?

43
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,382
Thanks, man.

44
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,720
So, this is your old room, huh?

45
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,473
Thanks.

46
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,977
Later.

47
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,443
I'll take care of the tart.

48
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,990
Look at this.

49
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,408
Good morning, Professor.

50
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,951
- Good morning.
- Back from the dead.

51
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,037
- Was I out that long?
- It seemed like it, huh?

52
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,498
- How are you?
- I... Well, rested now.

53
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,041
- Thank you.
- I'm glad.

54
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,417
Would you like some espresso?

55
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,503
I would love some. Thank you very much.

56
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,922
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat, did I?

57
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,716
No, no, no. It's okay. Please.

58
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,760
Did you...
Did you recover from your trip?

59
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,220
I did. Yeah, big time.

60
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,013
- Thank you.
- Good.

61
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,682
I could show you around.

62
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,392
That'd be great. Thank you.

63
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,394
Is there a... Is there a bank in town?

64
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,771
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.

65
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,440
Let me do it.

66
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,733
Sorry.

67
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,278
- It happens to the best of us.
- Yeah, well...

68
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,281
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.

69
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,825
Really?

70
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,702
Should I take him to Montodine?

71
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,995
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.

72
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,456
You try Crema.

73
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,833
Crema?

74
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,418
Thank you.

75
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,086
Is this your orchard?

76
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,587
These are Annella's trees.

77
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,550
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

78
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,386
Pomegranate.

79
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,935
Have another egg.

80
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,437
Oh, stupid.

81
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,313
No, no, no. I know myself too well.

82
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,982
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,

83
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,900
and then a fourth, and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.

84
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,988
- Delicious.
- Darling?

85
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,489
Thank you.

86
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,992
Shall I give him Anchise's bike?

87
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,114
So, what does one do around here?

88
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,825
Wait for the summer to end.

89
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,327
Yeah?

90
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,620
What do you do in the winter?

91
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,915
- Wait for summer to come?
- Well, we only come here for Christmas

92
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,583
and some other vacations.

93
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,043
- Christmas? I thought you...
- And Easter as well.

94
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,628
- Thought you were Jewish.
- Well, we are Jewish,

95
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,963
but also American, Italian, French.

96
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,299
Somewhat atypical combination.

97
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,260
Besides my family, you're probably

98
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,262
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

99
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,224
I'm from a small town in New England.

100
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,475
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

101
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,395
So, what do you do around here?

102
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,732
Just read books.

103
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,902
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

104
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,654
- Yeah?
- Go out at night.

105
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,948
- I don't know.
- That sounds fun.

106
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,745
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

107
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,506
Sorry. Sorry about that.

108
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,049
It's all right.

109
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,134
All right, later.

110
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,771
What do you have there?

111
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,773
That should all be...

112
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,695
What is this?

113
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,283
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...

114
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:41,951
These are archaeology?

115
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,744
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.

116
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,912
Okay.

117
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,373
- More apricot juice?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,876
- Here, tesoro.
- Thank you.

119
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,335
Help yourself, darling.

120
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,712
Thanks.

121
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,305
Help yourself to some more.

122
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,476
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

123
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,147
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

124
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,815
It derives from an Arabic noun

125
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,817
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.

126
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,821
The origin of our Italian albicocca

127
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,531
is al-barquq.

128
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,034
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,

129
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,787
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name, mismish.

130
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,749
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.

131
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,544
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second.

132
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,005
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

133
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,341
do find their origins in Greek words.

134
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,759
However, in the case of "apricot,"

135
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,636
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

136
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,179
How so?

137
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,223
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

138
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,268
Latin word being
praecoquum or precoquere.

139
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,103
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

140
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,855
To be precocious or premature.

141
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,777
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed praecox,

142
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:01,197
which became prekokkia,
which then became berikokki,

143
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,115
which is how the Arabs got al-barquq.

144
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,795
That's courtesy of Philology 101.

145
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,464
Flying colors.

146
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,761
He does this every year.

147
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,071
It's about drink time. Let's go here.

148
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,241
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

149
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,910
- How are you?
- All good.

150
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,709
Ciao, boys!

151
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,627
All good?

152
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,379
All good!

153
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,964
Let's see. What have we got?

154
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,883
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

155
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,822
Good morning, gentlemen.

156
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,871
How do you know about this place?

157
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,041
Okay.

158
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,876
Go, Chiara!

159
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,676
No, no, no, no, no!

160
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,220
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

161
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,680
Remember?

162
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,599
Get in there!

163
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,560
Much better!
See how cute he is.

164
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,782
Elio, water!

165
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,576
Perfect timing.

166
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,664
What's the matter? Are you all right?

167
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,542
- What, pinch a nerve?
- I'm okay.

168
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,544
Here. Hold this.

169
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,630
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

170
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,465
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.

171
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,800
You're too stressed.

172
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,344
- You just gotta relax a little bit.
- I am relaxing.

173
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,179
Marzia, come here for a minute.

174
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,640
Back me up here.

175
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,558
- Feel that. Right there?
- Oliver.

176
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,893
- It's too tight, right?
- Yeah.

177
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,186
- He needs to relax.
- Oliver!

178
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,521
Later.

179
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,064
You should relax more.

180
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,484
Okay, guys, ready?

181
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,785
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

182
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,162
Twelve serving 11.

183
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,039
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

184
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,416
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.

185
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,380
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

186
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,883
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

187
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,301
Don't know.

188
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,679
What a movie star!

189
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,473
Yes, those Americans...

190
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,707
Sparkling wine!

191
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,042
He's late.

192
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,712
Don't you think...

193
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,716
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

194
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,510
Arrogant.

195
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,929
I don't think he's arrogant.

196
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,181
Just watch.

197
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,600
This is how he'll say good-bye
to us when the time comes.

198
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,894
With his... "Later."

199
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,898
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.

200
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,108
Won't we, darling?

201
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,527
I think he's shy.

202
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,279
You'll grow to like him.

203
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,405
What if I grow to hate him?

204
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,656
Oh, no, sweetheart.

205
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,453
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

206
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,625
Darling?

207
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,647
Elio, play something.

208
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't want to.

209
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,484
Why not?

210
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,027
Because I don't want to.

211
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,446
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

212
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,240
Because I don't want to.

213
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,450
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

214
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,585
Play well, darling.

215
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,597
- Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,973
What are you doing?

217
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,266
Reading.

218
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,728
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

219
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,274
- I have an allergy. It's...
- Yeah, me too.

220
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,526
Maybe we have the same one.

221
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,073
Why don't you and I go swimming?

222
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,075
- Right now?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,327
Come on. Let's go.

224
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,704
Do we have to go right now?

225
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,707
- I'll go get changed.
- Okay.

226
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,250
Meet you downstairs.

227
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,437
See you downstairs.

228
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,850
Elio, what are you doing?

229
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,518
Reading my music.

230
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,979
No, you're not.

231
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,231
- Thinking, then.
- Yeah?

232
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,735
About what?

233
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,781
It's private.

234
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,616
You're not gonna tell me?

235
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,452
I'm not gonna tell you.

236
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,454
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

237
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,621
Elio.

238
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,373
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

239
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,543
More apricot juice, please.

240
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,629
That's a good boy.

241
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,256
Thank God you're helping me.

242
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,363
Sounds nice.

243
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,657
Thought you didn't like it.

244
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,040
Play it again, will you?

245
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,384
Follow me.

246
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,710
That sounds different.
Did you change it?

247
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,463
- Well, I changed it a little bit.
- Why?

248
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,632
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it

249
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,009
if he'd altered Bach's version.

250
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,970
Play that again.

251
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,097
- Play what again?
- The thing you played outside.

252
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,474
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?

253
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,519
- Please.
- Of course.

254
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,627
I can't believe you changed it again.

255
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,255
- I changed it a little bit.
- Yeah. Why?

256
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,716
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

257
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,301
if he'd altered Liszt's version.

258
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,303
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...

259
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,929
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

260
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,347
In fact, we're not even sure

261
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,308
- Bach wrote it at all.
- Forget I asked.

262
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,465
It's young Bach.

263
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,425
He dedicated it to his brother.

264
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,669
Hey, Professor.

265
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,920
Hello.

266
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,130
Here, please.

267
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,799
I need help.

268
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,260
Just be honest.

269
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,553
How bad is it?

270
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,265
I think your insights here
are persuasive, but...

271
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,771
Have you been to the river?

272
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,453
Mafalda!

273
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,372
Isn't she beautiful?

274
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,268
Elio.

275
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,979
You sleeping?

276
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,773
I was.

277
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,526
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

278
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,821
- Wait.
- What?

279
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,614
Can't hear you.

280
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,542
"For the early Greeks,

281
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,252
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness

282
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,129
"is constitutive of the way beings are,

283
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,547
"not only in relation to themselves

284
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,258
"but also in relation
to other entities generally.

285
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,051
"In other words,
they do not construe hiddenness

286
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,638
"merely or primarily in terms of
entities' relations to human beings."

287
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,058
Does that make any sense to you?

288
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,519
Doesn't make any sense to me.

289
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,563
I don't think it makes
any sense to your dad, either.

290
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,608
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

291
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,407
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.

292
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,118
"Kind"?

293
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,204
Yep. Kind.

294
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:31,066
- Hey, Elio.
- Hey.

295
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,526
Hey!

296
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,530
Come here.

297
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,283
What's going on?

298
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,160
Is he trying to get it on with her?

299
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,412
Elio, he already succeeded?

300
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,749
What do I know?

301
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,501
I'd love to be in his shoes.

302
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,503
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

303
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,216
She wants him, no matter what!

304
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,636
Coming?

305
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,307
I'll come later.

306
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,593
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

307
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,345
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

308
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,056
Because of him.

309
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,599
Because of who?

310
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,018
Of Oliver.

311
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,906
Turn around.

312
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,381
Meet me here tomorrow night?

313
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,557
Wait for me!

314
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,183
Come on.

315
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,615
We almost had sex last night...

316
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,076
Marzia and me.

317
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,580
Well, why didn't you?

318
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,874
I don't know.

319
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,711
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

320
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,590
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out and touch.

321
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,216
She would have said yes.

322
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,052
Well, try again later.

323
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,928
Try what later?

324
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,680
I just heard
from the people in Sirmione.

325
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,599
They say they've come up with something.

326
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,976
Fantastic.

327
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,603
Going there today.

328
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,022
- Would you like to come along?
- I would love to. Thank you.

329
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,609
- Smell this.
- Can I come, too?

330
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,278
On the condition you remain silent.

331
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,197
Silent as in,
"He has too many opinions,"

332
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,865
or silent as in,
"Just not telling anybody

333
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,617
"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?

334
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,243
Well, nothing has been dug up.

335
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,954
It's what has been brought out,
out of the water.

336
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,173
What are you doing?

337
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,217
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

338
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,302
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

339
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,638
Can you tell him I came by?

340
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,474
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

341
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,729
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

342
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,689
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

343
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,735
He's good-looking too.

344
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,988
- Want to get us together?
- No.

345
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,408
Come in.

346
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,698
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.

347
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,749
She seems to like you a lot.

348
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,502
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.

349
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,382
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

350
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,426
Great body.

351
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,178
Trying to get me to like her?

352
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:35,346
What would be the harm in that?

353
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,639
No, no harm.

354
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,766
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.

355
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,939
I'll drive today!

356
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,321
Just don't play at being the good host.

357
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,618
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

358
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,455
What's going on, boys?

359
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:07,086
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

360
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,631
What? What?

361
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,856
- Dr. Roseburg.
- Samuel!

362
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,900
- Benvenuto.
- Look who's here.

363
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,237
- He's grown a bit, eh?
- And this is Oliver.

364
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,518
Sammy! Come on!

365
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,032
Truce?

366
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,327
Hey, boys.

367
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:32,297
The ship went down in 1827
on the way to Isola del Garda

368
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:36,509
Gossip has it this statue
was a gift from Count Lechi

369
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,762
to his lover,
contralto Adelaide Malanotte.

370
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,561
There are four known sets,
after the Praxiteles originals.

371
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,187
This fellow's at number three.

372
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,857
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,

373
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,861
but one of the more philistine
of the Farnese Popes melted them down

374
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,781
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous Venus.

375
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,680
Who'd like to go for a swim
before we head back?

376
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:28,061
We're all such pros. If I got my own
statue, it would probably be on there.

377
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,569
Elio!

378
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,613
Oliver!

379
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,951
- I have to go. I have to go.
- Hey! Hey!

380
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,745
I have to go.

381
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,082
Goodness.

382
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,171
- Are you going, too?
- No, no.

383
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,340
I should stay
and do some work on my book.

384
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,009
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

385
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:03,304
- Okay, maybe just one.
- All right!

386
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,025
Marzia?

387
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,634
The Cosmic Fragments by Heraclitus.

388
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:35,104
The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing

389
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,190
so that we cannot encounter them twice,

390
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:40,401
but that some things
stay the same only by changing.

391
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,035
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

392
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,583
Leave the door open.

393
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,378
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

394
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,090
Darling, have you seen my Heptaméron?

395
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,344
Mafalda.

396
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,642
It's in German.

397
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:44,895
Okay.

398
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:51,444
I can't remember where we left off,
but I think you'll like this one.

399
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,615
Come here, darling.

400
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,369
So, I'll translate, huh?

401
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:13,799
"A handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess.

402
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,885
"And she, too, is in love with him,

403
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,598
"though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

404
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,392
"Despite the friendship..."

405
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:28,981
"...that blossoms between them,

406
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,902
"or perhaps because of
that very friendship,

407
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,489
"the young knight finds himself so..."

408
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,994
"...so humbled and speechless

409
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:47,082
"that he's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.

410
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,670
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."

411
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,184
"Is it better to speak or to die?"

412
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,609
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

413
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,445
I doubt that.

414
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,577
Hey, Elly-Belly.

415
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,540
You do know that
you can always talk to us.

416
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:37,299
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.

417
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,677
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

418
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:43,138
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

419
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,306
Right.

420
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,976
So, does he or doesn't he?

421
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,771
"Better to speak," she said.

422
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,483
But she's on her guard.

423
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,778
She senses a trap somewhere.

424
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,036
So, does he speak?

425
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:08,372
No.

426
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,792
He fudges.

427
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,255
It figures. He's French.

428
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,889
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.

429
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:28,434
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

430
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,186
Then why don't we go together?

431
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,438
Right now?

432
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,732
Yeah. Right now.

433
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:38,193
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.

434
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,613
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."

435
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:53,959
Mind if I put this in your bag?

436
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:55,044
Yes, please.

437
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,140
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

438
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,642
Perfect. Thanks.

439
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:16,190
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

440
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,068
Anchise insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

441
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,694
I think it helped.

442
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,428
Hold this for a second, will you?

443
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,658
- Want one?
- Sure.

444
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,600
Not bad, huh?

445
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,519
Not bad at all.

446
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:39,857
I thought you didn't smoke.

447
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,568
I don't.

448
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,201
- So, World War II, huh?
- No. This is World War I.

449
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,455
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

450
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,666
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

451
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,419
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

452
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,796
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.

453
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,175
Is there anything you don't know?

454
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,597
I know nothing, Oliver.

455
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,353
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.

456
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,898
Well, if you only knew how little
I know about the things that matter.

457
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,486
What things that matter?

458
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,952
You know what things.

459
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:42,503
Why are you telling me this?

460
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,133
'Cause I thought you should know.

461
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,887
Because you thought I should know?

462
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,016
'Cause I wanted you to know?

463
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,563
Because I wanted you to know.

464
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,277
Because I wanted you to know.

465
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,493
'Cause I wanted you to know.

466
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,257
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.

467
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,765
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

468
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,441
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

469
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,528
You know I'm not going anywhere.

470
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,517
They mixed up all of my pages.

471
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,728
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

472
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,563
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.

473
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,231
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

474
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,108
Damn it.

475
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,320
Shouldn't have said anything.

476
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:32,779
Just pretend you never did.

477
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,115
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?

478
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,954
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.

479
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,332
Okay?

480
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,293
We just can't.

481
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,601
Hey.

482
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,354
Let's go, American!

483
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:28,085
- Ready?
- Let's go.

484
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:04,871
Pretty much.

485
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,673
Oh, my God.

486
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,800
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

487
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,679
Good morning, ma'am.

488
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:23,557
Excuse me.

489
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,185
Could I ask for a glass of water?

490
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,197
Il Duce.

491
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,074
"People of Italy!"

492
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:43,577
That's Italy.

493
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

494
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:28,914
Come on!

495
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:53,355
This is my spot. It's all mine.

496
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:56,691
Come here to read.

497
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,112
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.

498
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,200
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

499
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,786
Spring is in the mountains.

500
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,038
The Alpi Orobie.

501
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,749
The water comes
straight down from there.

502
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:40,944
I like the way you say things.

503
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,196
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

504
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,657
So you won't, I guess.

505
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,997
You really that afraid of what I think?

506
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,470
You're making things
very difficult for me.

507
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:21,151
I love this, Oliver.

508
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,033
What?

509
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,497
Everything.

510
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,920
Us, you mean?

511
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,048
It's not bad.

512
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,175
It's not bad.

513
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,231
Better now?

514
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,866
No, no, no.

515
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,578
- We should go.
- Why?

516
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,956
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.

517
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,291
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,

518
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,667
and that's a good thing.

519
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:02,460
I wanna be good.

520
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,212
Okay?

521
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,846
Am I offending you?

522
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:20,895
Just don't.

523
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,196
I think it's starting to get infected.

524
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:33,825
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.

525
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,827
Excellent idea.

526
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:46,379
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

527
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,007
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

528
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,009
Let me speak.

529
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:54,638
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

530
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,474
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

531
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,477
I'd like to know what they think too.

532
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,396
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

533
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,691
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

534
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:10,862
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

535
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,740
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

536
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,533
What's that got to do with it?

537
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,410
What are you saying?

538
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,788
You're mad, darling.

539
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:21,831
You asshole!

540
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,794
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

541
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,546
Say something.

542
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,340
You're resigned.

543
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,009
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

544
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:36,137
Buñuel was a genius.

545
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,847
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

546
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:41,226
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

547
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,021
They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty
with constant interr...

548
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,607
Everyone loves Buñuel!

549
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,275
Let's hear his opinion.

550
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,820
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

551
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,863
Say something. Give us your impression.

552
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,532
Do you have an impression?

553
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,701
Darling, he's American.

554
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,160
That doesn't mean stupid!

555
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,210
Just stop.

556
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:11,214
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

557
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,175
She didn't say that.

558
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,177
I'm going to go mad.

559
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,138
What's the matter?

560
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,141
What's wrong?

561
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,268
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

562
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,563
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

563
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,315
You get used to absolutely everything.

564
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,855
Don't you realize
you're mixing everything up?

565
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,607
What are you talking about?

566
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:13,485
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

567
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,154
Elio?

568
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,201
Elio.

569
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,161
You all right?

570
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,705
Sit for a second.

571
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,167
If you insist.

572
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,174
- That wasn't my fault, right?
- No.

573
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,011
I'm a mess.

574
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:46,100
Well, the kitchen table sure is.

575
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:53,525
Where did you learn to do that?

576
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,945
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.

577
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,696
Trust me, it helps.

578
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,537
I used to have one of these.

579
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,205
- You used to?
- Yeah.

580
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,207
How come you never wear it?

581
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,377
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.

582
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,087
Well...

583
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,173
I guess that works for your mother.

584
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:19,717
Funny witch.

585
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:27,100
Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.

586
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,018
I hope not.

587
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,030
Hey, are you leaving?

588
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,907
- Where's Elio?
- He's inside.

589
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:45,201
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.

590
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,953
- Really?
- Yeah.

591
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,663
- Okay. Bye.
- I'll be back in a minute.

592
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,373
Don't go anywhere.

593
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:03,845
You okay?

594
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,979
Are we going out?

595
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:18,276
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

596
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,486
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

597
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,368
Where's Oliver?

598
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,037
Don't ask me.

599
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:47,972
Where's Oliver?

600
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,684
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

601
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,395
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

602
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:55,813
All right.

603
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,190
I'm going out tonight.

604
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:00,610
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

605
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,403
This is no good, madam.

606
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,614
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

607
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,741
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

608
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,451
She's worried about you.

609
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,750
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

610
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,586
Everyone likes Oliver.

611
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,089
I think he likes you too.

612
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:22,465
More than you do.

613
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,970
Is that your impression?

614
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,931
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

615
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,308
A while ago.

616
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,085
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

617
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,670
I have no idea.

618
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,380
Traitor.

619
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,642
Traitor.

620
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:37,368
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

621
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,886
- Hey.
- Hi!

622
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,681
It's me. Is that Marzia?

623
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:00,600
Sure it is! Can't you tell?

624
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:01,726
Sorry.

625
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,080
Is that for me?

626
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,750
Thanks.

627
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:44,644
Do you really read a lot?

628
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,480
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

629
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:49,732
Why not?

630
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,150
I don't know.

631
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,570
I think...

632
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,615
people who read are...

633
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,367
kind of secretive.

634
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:03,204
They hide who they really are.

635
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,415
Do you hide who you really are?

636
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,751
No, not with you.

637
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,002
Not with me?

638
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:16,259
Well, maybe a bit.

639
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:17,802
What do you mean?

640
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:21,472
You know exactly what I mean.

641
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,266
Why do you say that?

642
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,017
Why?

643
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,521
Because...

644
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,815
I think...

645
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,900
you're going to hurt me,

646
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,777
and I don't want to be hurt.

647
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:53,546
You're so hard.

648
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,304
Wait.

649
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,805
Kiss me.

650
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:11,897
- Is that good?
- Yes.

651
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,400
Are you lying?

652
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,581
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

653
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,875
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

654
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:44,096
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

655
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,432
Leave me alone.

656
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,268
Fuck, that felt good.

657
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,861
Please don't avoid me.

658
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:01,030
It kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.

659
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:03,532
Your silence is killing me.
I'd sooner die than know you hate me.

660
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:04,909
I am such a pussy.

661
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:09,455
Way over the top.

662
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,342
Can't stand the silence.

663
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,677
Need to speak to you.

664
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,786
Did someone have a good night
last night?

665
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,663
Not really.

666
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:56,877
Well, you must be tired, then.

667
01:10:57,796 --> 01:10:59,797
Or were you playing poker, too?

668
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,882
I don't play poker.

669
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:05,094
Several hundred color slides
of our boxer and the others like him

670
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,054
arrived yesterday from Berlin.

671
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,640
We should start cataloging them.

672
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,475
That'll keep us busy till lunch,
I imagine.

673
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,643
Sure.

674
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:17,148
Beautiful, aren't they?

675
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,402
They're all so incredibly sensual.

676
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:24,488
Because these are more Hellenistic
than 5th century Athenian.

677
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,534
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

678
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,245
Right.

679
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:35,875
Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

680
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,567
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

681
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:15,039
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

682
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:21,462
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.

683
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,840
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.

684
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:28,427
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.

685
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,305
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

686
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:35,309
As if they're daring you to desire them.

687
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,206
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.

688
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,084
- Also known as Sonny and Cher.
- Okay.

689
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,337
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.

690
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,421
No.

691
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,175
- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
- I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.

692
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,094
- Come on. It will make them so happy.
- It looks ridiculous on me.

693
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,220
I'll try it on for Oliver.

694
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,805
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,

695
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,265
I'm not wearing it.

696
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,474
Oliver?

697
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,561
Hey, what time you got?

698
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,771
It's 2:00.

699
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:28,279
- Well... Later.
- Later.

700
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,792
Mafalda.

701
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,338
I won't be here for dinner.

702
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,173
Okay, Mr. Oliver.

703
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,790
Hello, Mafalda.

704
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,916
Marzia.

705
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:27,338
Where are we going?

706
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:28,672
You'll see.

707
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:44,897
Stop it!

708
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,971
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

709
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,057
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

710
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,601
- How are you?
- You've grown.

711
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,144
- How are you.
- I'm good.

712
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:30,437
Good to see you.

713
01:17:30,522 --> 01:17:32,523
Remember Marzia from last year.

714
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:33,690
Hello.

715
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:36,109
- Marzia, remember Isaac?
- The girl from Paris?

716
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:37,569
Good to meet you.

717
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,154
Want to eat with us tonight?

718
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,531
No, no. I have to go.

719
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,324
- You're sure?
- Yes.

720
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,409
- Okay.
- Have a nice evening.

721
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:45,619
Goodbye.

722
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:55,629
This right here is the brand-new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.

723
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,215
It looks wonderful.
Come here, Mounir, Mounir.

724
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,591
- Come, come, come.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

725
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,554
I can't put it on now.
They've already met me.

726
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,972
- Yes, you can.
- It'll look like a put-up job.

727
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:06,056
- Papa, it'll...
- Yes.

728
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,976
- Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.
- No misbehaving tonight.

729
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,020
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

730
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,606
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.

731
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,567
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?

732
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:18,569
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.

733
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:21,029
- That's what Mom calls them...
- Then you accept gifts from them.

734
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:24,032
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.

735
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,743
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

736
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,999
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age,

737
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:34,334
you'll be a very wise man, indeed.

738
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,087
And a credit to me.

739
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:40,173
Now, just get into this, you.

740
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:52,644
These are unbelievable. I just...

741
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,940
Hey, look who's here.

742
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,407
Sorry. I have to go to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

743
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:48,867
Thank you.

744
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:52,204
Elio. Elio.

745
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,749
- Thank you.
- Good night.

746
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,501
Good night.

747
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,090
Do I know you?

748
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:22,985
Thank you again for everything.

749
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,618
- They're never gonna make it.
- No, no. They're fine.

750
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,785
I'm glad you came.

751
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:26,298
Yeah, I'm nervous.

752
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,005
I like what you've done with the place.

753
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,425
It's nice.

754
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,079
You okay?

755
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:45,752
Me okay.

756
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,197
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, please.

757
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,717
What are you doing?

758
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:17,802
Nothing.

759
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,441
Does this make you happy?

760
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:34,903
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

761
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:36,821
I'm not gonna get...

762
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:08,561
Off, off, off, off, off.

763
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,441
Yeah. Just pull it.

764
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:17,153
Or I'll pull it.

765
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:49,728
Oliver.

766
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:33,521
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

767
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,485
Elio.

768
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,530
Oliver.

769
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:46,493
Elio.

770
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,538
- Oliver.
- Elio.

771
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,136
Did we make noise?

772
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,138
Nothing to worry about.

773
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:09,849
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.

774
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:11,810
Well, she's not gonna find any.

775
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:21,736
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

776
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,697
Will you give it to me when you go?

777
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:37,437
Let's go swimming.

778
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:33,076
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?

779
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:34,536
No.

780
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,107
Elio. Come here.

781
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,072
Take your trunks off.

782
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,173
Well, that's promising.

783
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:11,549
You're hard again.

784
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:12,967
Good.

785
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:59,639
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

786
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,516
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,

787
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,434
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

788
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,812
Later.

789
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:09,941
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

790
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,902
Okay. So later.

791
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,362
Later.

792
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,583
Oliver.

793
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:39,971
You're not sick of me yet?

794
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:42,765
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.

795
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:49,063
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

796
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:52,525
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

797
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,112
I don't know.

798
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,157
Of course, you don't know.

799
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:03,244
I don't want you to regret anything.

800
01:33:03,954 --> 01:33:06,873
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...

801
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:09,250
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

802
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,543
- one way or another.
- No, I...

803
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:12,837
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

804
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,381
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

805
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,508
That's not what I'm talking about.

806
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:30,938
Are you happy I came here?

807
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:39,572
I would kiss you if I could.

808
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,919
Times change.

809
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,796
Thank God we had the partisans.

810
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,050
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

811
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:01,219
What do you think of Bettino?

812
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:04,222
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

813
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:06,766
I'm happy, actually.

814
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,813
I don't know. We'll see.

815
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:16,818
Anyway, they make the rules.

816
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,031
Pasquina!

817
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,366
Hello.

818
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:24,826
Hello, ma'am.

819
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,870
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

820
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:52,788
Oh, fuck.

821
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,384
Fuck.

822
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,317
Fuck.

823
01:38:44,294 --> 01:38:45,419
What did you do?

824
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:47,797
- Nothing.
- No?

825
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,432
Oh, I see.

826
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:01,185
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

827
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,478
What's next? Minerals?

828
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:04,271
I suppose you've already
given up animals.

829
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:05,397
You know that's me.

830
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,067
I'm sick, aren't I?

831
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,030
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

832
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:15,407
Please don't do that.

833
01:39:15,492 --> 01:39:17,326
- You want to see something sick?
- Please don't do that.

834
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,494
You want to see something sick?

835
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:19,620
Please don't do this.

836
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:20,871
Hey. Please don't do it.

837
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:27,253
Why are you doing this to me?

838
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,047
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

839
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:32,133
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Then don't fight.

840
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,407
Sorry.

841
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,033
It's okay.

842
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:05,666
It's okay.

843
01:40:18,221 --> 01:40:19,346
It's okay.

844
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:21,974
I don't want you to go.

845
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,189
God, we wasted so many days.

846
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:29,857
Why didn't you give me a sign?

847
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:31,817
- I did. I did.
- You didn't give me a sign.

848
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:32,985
When?

849
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:35,779
You remember
when we were playing volleyball

850
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:37,656
and I touched you?

851
01:40:39,326 --> 01:40:43,037
Just to show you that I liked you?

852
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,582
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

853
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:47,958
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

854
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:50,085
I just decided
I should keep my distance.

855
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:53,297
I don't know.

856
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,929
I come out here for hours
almost every night.

857
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:02,431
I didn't know that.

858
01:41:05,227 --> 01:41:06,560
That's funny, I...

859
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:08,979
I thought that...

860
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:11,273
Yeah, I know what you thought.

861
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:13,359
Stop. Stop.

862
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:52,189
"For Oliver.

863
01:41:53,275 --> 01:41:54,650
"From Elio."

864
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,203
Elio?

865
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:20,009
You disappeared for three days.

866
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,181
I had to work.

867
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,768
You completely disappeared.

868
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,188
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

869
01:42:36,026 --> 01:42:37,568
I had a lot to do.

870
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,912
Am I your girl?

871
01:43:11,728 --> 01:43:14,646
Oliver has to go to Bergamo
for a few days.

872
01:43:14,731 --> 01:43:15,856
Oh?

873
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,524
Research at the university.

874
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:21,528
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

875
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:23,906
But what about Elio?

876
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:29,161
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them

877
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:31,080
to get away for a couple of days, no?

878
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:36,668
What do you think?

879
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:41,006
You know you've been
our favorite student?

880
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,425
- You must come back.
- You sure you're not just saying that?

881
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:45,552
- Oliver.
- Thank you very much, Professor.

882
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:49,181
Oh, man.

883
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,476
Please, please come back soon.

884
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,395
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

885
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:57,147
You're welcome.

886
01:43:58,316 --> 01:43:59,400
Oh, well...

887
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:02,152
- Thank you guys so much.
- Of course.

888
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,570
Oliver, Oliver.

889
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:06,281
- Come back.
- It's been...

890
01:44:06,658 --> 01:44:07,908
Come here, come here.

891
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,369
It's been amazing. Thank you guys.

892
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:13,539
Well, later, Perlmans.

893
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:15,999
Later. Later, later, later.

894
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:28,262
Tell Elio to call when you get there.

895
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,684
Oh, no.

896
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:51,952
Come for dinner tonight.

897
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,287
Bring Marzia.

898
01:44:54,873 --> 01:44:56,123
Bye, darling.

899
01:45:04,174 --> 01:45:05,716
- What?
- Nothing.

900
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,134
- What?
- Nothing.

901
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,023
Oh, to see without my eyes

902
01:45:22,025 --> 01:45:26,487
The first time that you kissed me

903
01:45:26,571 --> 01:45:29,865
Boundless by the time I cried

904
01:45:31,034 --> 01:45:34,912
I built your walls around me

905
01:45:35,163 --> 01:45:36,163
Yes!

906
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,790
White noise
What an awful sound

907
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:41,210
Oliver!

908
01:45:41,878 --> 01:45:43,170
Elio!

909
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:45,547
Elio!

910
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:52,804
Hand of God, deliver me

911
01:45:53,056 --> 01:45:56,850
Oh, woe is me

912
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,561
The first time that you touched me

913
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:02,397
- Oliver!
- Elio!

914
01:46:02,649 --> 01:46:05,442
Oh, will wonders never cease?

915
01:46:06,653 --> 01:46:11,823
Blessed be the mystery of love

916
01:46:24,629 --> 01:46:26,838
Lord, I no longer believe

917
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:29,675
Yes!

918
01:46:29,759 --> 01:46:33,262
Drowned in living waters

919
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:36,598
Cursed by the love that I received

920
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:42,145
From my brother's daughter

921
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:45,440
Like Hephaestion who died

922
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:51,154
Alexander's lover

923
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:55,284
Now I'm prone to misery

924
01:46:55,368 --> 01:46:57,494
The birthmark on your...

925
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:12,718
Oh, God.

926
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,872
And I'm feeling low

927
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:46,960
Understand I'm feeling low

928
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,149
You hear that?

929
01:48:10,485 --> 01:48:12,194
Wait, wait, wait.

930
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:16,198
No, no, no, it's this way.

931
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:18,367
Come on. Come on. You're missing it.

932
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:20,327
Come on.

933
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:29,795
Don't stop.

934
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:32,798
A kiss is not enough...

935
01:48:32,882 --> 01:48:34,716
This. This.

936
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:36,343
This. You.

937
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,761
You are...

938
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:39,596
Love my way

939
01:48:39,681 --> 01:48:42,766
It's a new road

940
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:46,186
I follow...

941
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,771
If you'll excuse me...

942
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,898
Just one second.

943
01:48:50,817 --> 01:48:52,234
One second!

944
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:56,863
They'd dearly make us pay

945
01:48:56,948 --> 01:49:00,409
For laughing in their faces

946
01:49:00,493 --> 01:49:03,620
And making it our way

947
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:08,500
There's emptiness behind their eyes

948
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:11,628
There's dust in all their hearts

949
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:13,839
I saw them last year.

950
01:49:14,674 --> 01:49:17,175
Richard Butler... fantastic!

951
01:49:17,343 --> 01:49:21,012
Really? We saw them in concert too.

952
01:49:21,097 --> 01:49:23,932
We hitchhiked to London.

953
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,351
What'd she say?

954
01:49:26,436 --> 01:49:29,604
It's a new road

955
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:32,691
I follow

956
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:36,027
Where my mind goes

957
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:39,990
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

958
01:51:22,093 --> 01:51:23,468
Did you get your passport?

959
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:26,721
You get your passport?

960
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:50,532
Mafalda?

961
01:53:51,534 --> 01:53:52,659
Mom?

962
01:53:53,786 --> 01:53:55,203
Yeah, it's me.

963
01:53:56,539 --> 01:53:58,915
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

964
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:00,959
in Clusone.

965
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:04,546
Listen, Mom, can you...

966
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:08,133
Can you come get me, Mom?

967
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:00,060
How are you?

968
01:55:00,728 --> 01:55:01,895
Good.

969
01:55:06,859 --> 01:55:09,110
I read the book you bought me.

970
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,529
The poems...

971
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:13,156
They're really beautiful.

972
01:55:13,282 --> 01:55:16,326
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

973
01:55:19,497 --> 01:55:21,498
I'm sorry, excuse me...

974
01:55:21,624 --> 01:55:23,333
that you're sad.

975
01:55:24,627 --> 01:55:27,545
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

976
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,339
I'm not mad at you.

977
01:55:30,925 --> 01:55:32,258
Not at all.

978
01:55:39,892 --> 01:55:41,184
I love you, Elio.

979
01:55:46,607 --> 01:55:47,941
Stay friends?

980
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:51,319
For life?

981
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:53,404
For life?

982
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:02,599
Missed you at dinner.

983
01:57:26,749 --> 01:57:28,208
So...

984
01:57:30,002 --> 01:57:31,044
Welcome home.

985
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:32,545
Thanks.

986
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,882
- Oliver enjoyed the trip?
- Yeah.

987
01:57:36,926 --> 01:57:37,967
I think he did.

988
01:57:39,345 --> 01:57:40,803
You two had a nice friendship.

989
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:44,265
Yeah.

990
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:53,191
You're too smart not to know how rare,

991
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:58,071
how special what you two had was.

992
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:02,867
Oliver was Oliver.

993
01:58:06,372 --> 01:58:08,289
Because it was him.

994
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:11,292
Because it was me.

995
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:13,544
Oliver may be very intelligent but...

996
01:58:14,463 --> 01:58:16,047
He was more than intelligent.

997
01:58:18,259 --> 01:58:19,300
What you two had,

998
01:58:21,262 --> 01:58:24,222
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

999
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:25,974
He was good.

1000
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:31,229
You're both lucky
to have found each other

1001
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:33,898
because you, too, are good...

1002
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,615
I think he was better than...

1003
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:46,202
I think he was better than me.

1004
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:51,207
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.

1005
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:53,668
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

1006
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:55,878
It flatters you both.

1007
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:01,259
And when you least expect it,

1008
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:06,723
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.

1009
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:13,062
Just remember, I am here.

1010
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:23,031
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,

1011
01:59:24,533 --> 01:59:26,534
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

1012
01:59:30,372 --> 01:59:33,166
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about this things

1013
01:59:35,586 --> 01:59:38,379
but feel something you obviously did.

1014
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:44,802
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

1015
01:59:46,513 --> 01:59:48,014
Maybe more than a friendship.

1016
01:59:49,725 --> 01:59:51,017
And I envy you.

1017
01:59:54,188 --> 01:59:57,523
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

1018
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:00,610
Pray their sons land on their feet,

1019
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,614
but I am not such a parent.

1020
02:00:07,826 --> 02:00:11,329
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1021
02:00:12,456 --> 02:00:14,707
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

1022
02:00:16,418 --> 02:00:19,587
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.

1023
02:00:22,132 --> 02:00:24,008
But to make yourself feel nothing

1024
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:26,677
so as not to feel anything.

1025
02:00:28,806 --> 02:00:29,889
What a waste.

1026
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:39,190
Have I spoken out of turn?

1027
02:00:44,196 --> 02:00:45,613
And I'll say one more thing,

1028
02:00:49,493 --> 02:00:50,701
it'll clear the air.

1029
02:00:53,705 --> 02:00:55,123
I may have come close

1030
02:00:56,667 --> 02:00:58,209
but I never had what you two have.

1031
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:04,382
Something always held me back

1032
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:07,593
or stood in the way.

1033
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,684
How you live your life is your business.

1034
02:01:14,977 --> 02:01:17,520
Just remember,

1035
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:22,859
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1036
02:01:25,988 --> 02:01:28,823
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1037
02:01:29,575 --> 02:01:31,659
And as for your body,

1038
02:01:32,035 --> 02:01:34,162
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

1039
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:37,498
much less wants to come near it.

1040
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:47,467
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

1041
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:49,343
Don't kill it,

1042
02:01:51,013 --> 02:01:53,681
and with it, the joy you felt.

1043
02:02:05,777 --> 02:02:07,153
Does Mom know?

1044
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:14,494
I don't think she does.

1045
02:03:19,309 --> 02:03:21,894
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

1046
02:03:29,194 --> 02:03:30,528
Latkes.

1047
02:03:31,822 --> 02:03:33,489
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!

1048
02:03:33,615 --> 02:03:34,699
To you too.

1049
02:03:55,387 --> 02:03:56,846
She looks a bit weak.

1050
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:06,981
She comes highly recommended by...

1051
02:04:08,066 --> 02:04:12,069
Her special area of study is...

1052
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:16,741
I'll get it.

1053
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:21,662
Hello?

1054
02:04:21,747 --> 02:04:23,456
Elio, you there?

1055
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:26,667
- Hi.
- Hey.

1056
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:29,045
- How are you.
- I'm good.

1057
02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:30,796
I'm good. How are you?

1058
02:04:30,881 --> 02:04:32,548
- How are your parents?
- I'm good. They're fine.

1059
02:04:33,133 --> 02:04:34,258
Good.

1060
02:04:36,094 --> 02:04:37,219
I miss you.

1061
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:39,805
I miss you too.

1062
02:04:41,058 --> 02:04:42,099
Very much.

1063
02:04:46,313 --> 02:04:48,981
- I have some news.
- News?

1064
02:04:51,818 --> 02:04:53,402
What, you're getting married?

1065
02:04:53,904 --> 02:04:55,071
I suppose.

1066
02:04:57,449 --> 02:04:59,992
I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.

1067
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:05,247
You never said anything.

1068
02:05:07,376 --> 02:05:09,543
Been off and on for three years.

1069
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:14,924
That's wonderful news.

1070
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:18,260
Do you mind?

1071
02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:26,769
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

1072
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:28,854
- Oliver.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1073
02:05:28,939 --> 02:05:30,231
Darling, when are you coming back?

1074
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:32,149
I wish I was.

1075
02:05:32,484 --> 02:05:35,903
You caught us in the process of choosing
the new you for next summer.

1076
02:05:36,154 --> 02:05:38,656
- And guess what? He's a she.
- Oh, no.

1077
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:41,450
Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.

1078
02:05:43,412 --> 02:05:45,538
Wonderful!

1079
02:05:45,622 --> 02:05:47,498
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov!

1080
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:49,667
- Congratulations, Oliver.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1081
02:05:49,751 --> 02:05:53,129
Listen, we'll leave you...
We'll let you speak to Elio.

1082
02:05:53,338 --> 02:05:55,423
- Happy Hanukkah!
- Happy Hanukkah!

1083
02:05:55,507 --> 02:05:56,632
Bye, sweetheart.

1084
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:05,808
They know about us.

1085
02:06:07,269 --> 02:06:08,436
I figured.

1086
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:12,148
How?

1087
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,776
Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.

1088
02:06:17,195 --> 02:06:19,113
He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.

1089
02:06:19,698 --> 02:06:20,990
Almost like a son-in-law.

1090
02:06:23,201 --> 02:06:24,326
You're so lucky.

1091
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:28,706
My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.

1092
02:06:31,251 --> 02:06:32,501
Elio.

1093
02:06:36,131 --> 02:06:40,176
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

1094
02:06:43,847 --> 02:06:45,347
Oliver.

1095
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:49,769
I remember everything.

1096
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:55,931
Elio.

1097
02:10:58,184 --> 02:10:59,184
Elio.

1098
02:11:00,305 --> 02:11:06,651

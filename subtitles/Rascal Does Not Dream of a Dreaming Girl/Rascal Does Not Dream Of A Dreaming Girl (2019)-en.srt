Three Years Ago

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,910
Hurry up!

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,460
Hang on!

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,460
Plans for the Future

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,340
Does everyone have one?

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,300
Yes!

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,750
Plans for the Future

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,550
Write down your dreams for the future.

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,060

December 7th

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,740
Gently scrub in the direction of the fur.

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,580
You're getting good at this, Makinohara-san.

25
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,660
Thank you.

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,500
But I'm sorry.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,040
I said I would take Hayate in,

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,290
but I still haven't
brought it up with my parents.

29
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,090
Are they strict?

30
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,760
They're really nice.

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,430
If I say I want to adopt a cat,

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,010
there's no way they'll refuse.

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,100
That's why I can't ask.

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,730
I'm sorry. That doesn't
explain it very well, does it?

35
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,730
December 8th

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,780
Shouko-chan hadn't visited in a while, right?

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,900
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,700
She said she might not be able to again for some time.

39
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,580
Maybe she's going somewhere for New Year's.

40
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,370
What's your schedule looking like?

41
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,580
It's still up in the air.

42
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,920
But I do have New Year's Day off.

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,920
There's Christmas before that.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,170
It'd be great if we could eat some cake together.

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,340
Spend it with Kaede-chan this year.

46
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,470
Christmas with my sister?

47
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,100
If you do, I'll give you a present.

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,680
Something lewd?!

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,480
Ow...

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,070
What's up, Sakuta?
You're grinning from ear to ear.

51
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,650
I bet Sakurajima-senpai
stepped on his foot or something.

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,860
Want me to step on it too?

53
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,740
That did happen,
but it's not why I'm grinning.

54
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,620
You really are a teenage pig.

55
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,720
We're bringing out the kotatsu?

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,430
Well, we are having hotpot.

57
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,600
Can't do hotpot without a kotatsu.

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,850
Sakuta, help me out for a sec.

59
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,510
Sure.

60
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,730
Who could that be?

61
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,400
Good evening! It's me!

62
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,850
Shouko-san?

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,320
Sorry for dropping by so late unannounced.

64
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm hoping you can let me stay the night.

65
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
O-Onii-chan...

66
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,410
What's the meaning of this, Sakuta?

67
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,450
C-Calm down, Mai-san!

68
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,620
I am perfectly calm. But what is this about?

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,580
No idea. I'd like to know myself.

70
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,170
Then I guess I'll have to ask her directly.

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,090
Wait, Mai-san! Put the knife away!

72
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,430
That was delicious!

73
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,810
Sorry for imposing on you for dinner too.

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,520
I'll do the cooking from tomorrow, okay?

75
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,070
"From tomorrow"?

76
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,690
Aren't you only staying for the night?

77
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,530
I have nowhere else to go.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,990
How long are you going to stay?

79
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,660
Forever, if possible.

80
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,780
Forever?!

81
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,540
Thanks for the food and the tea.

82
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,450
I'll leave you to it.

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,580
Who exactly are you, anyway?

84
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,130
How are you related to Shouko-chan,
the middle schooler?

85
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,710
They're both me. Makinohara Shouko.

86
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,300
I grow up from time to time.

87
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,510
Huh?

88
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,470
I said, I grow up from time to time.

89
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,970
Is that your Puberty Syndrome?

90
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,850
Looks like it.

91
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,560
And I can't go home like this.

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,400
So you're the only one I can turn to.

93
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,520
In that case...

94
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,990
You can stay at my place.

95
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,610
Oh, I can't bother you like that.

96
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,570
But you don't mind bothering Sakuta?

97
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,740
Sakuta-kun, am I being a bother?

98
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,370
W-Well, no, not exactly...

99
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,830
If you're happy with your relationship with Mai-san,

100
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,920
you won't get any funny ideas, right?

101
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,920
You are happy, right?

102
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,050
Y-Yes, of course.

103
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,890
Then there's no problem with my living here.

104
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,010
No means no.

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,220
But yes means yes.

106
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,350
No!

107
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,230
Not that I'd mind if something did happen.

108
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,690
I love Sakuta-kun, after all.

109
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,650
Oh dear, what a mess.

110
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,400
There, there.

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,610
Are you okay?

112
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,200
Very well.

113
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,450
If you're insistent on doing this,
then I'll stay here as well.

114
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,460
H-Hey, Mai-san?!

115
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,500
Hold up! Timeout! Calm down!

116
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,210
Please help me.

117
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,170
What?

118
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,340
I met Shouko-san again.

119
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,090
Looking for advice on how to cheat?

120
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,050
She's at my place now.

121
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,190
And so is Mai-san.

122
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,970
Don't drag me into your love triangle!

123
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,190
December 9th

124
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,650
Wake up, Sakuta.

125
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,490
Come on, wake up.

126
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,310
I can't get up without a good-morning kiss.

127
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,240
Oh, really?

128
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,240
I'll head to school by myself, then.

129
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,910
I can take care of the good-morning kiss!

130
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,370
No, you can't.

131
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,630
You accepted us living together last night!

132
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,040
No, I did not.

133
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,470
Why not just two-time them
and upgrade from pig to scumbag?

134
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,800
Please don't suggest things
that'll get me killed.

135
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,180
Is that book interesting?

136
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,390
It is.

137
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,770
"Superstring Theory"?

138
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,890
Unraveling
Superstring
Theory

139
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,890
Is that about the thread of fate
linking me and Mai-san?

140
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,310
That's an awfully threadbare theory.

141
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,270
It's not even a theory.

142
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,110
Senpai, your eyes look dead again.

143
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,570
Get used to it.

144
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,200
Huh? You're leaving already?

145
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,030
I'm taking my sister to the hospital for her checkup.

146
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,290
Fujisawa General Hospital

147
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,620
See you in a bit, then.

148
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,420
Sure. I'll be in the waiting room.

149
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,350
Makinohara-san?

150
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,270
I-I can explain!

151
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,070
He must've met my younger self by now.

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,490
You see, I have a frail body.

153
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,740
I've been living in and out of the hospital since elementary school.

154
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,080
I see...

155
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,950
That's why I couldn't ask my parents about Hayate.

156
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Because I'm sick,

157
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,090
they give me anything I ask for.

158
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,510
That makes me really happy,

159
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,470
but it's also just as painful.

160
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,180
I feel like I should be saying sorry.

161
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,730
I'm sure your parents have noticed that.

162
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,230
How do you feel about your mom and dad?

163
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,980
I love them, of course.

164
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,070
Have you ever told them that?

165
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Never.

166
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,450
Instead of "I'm sorry,"

167
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,160
I'd be way happier hearing
the words "thank you."

168
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,250
And "I love you" would put me on cloud nine.

169
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,420
Someone once told me that "thank you," "you did well," and "I love you"

170
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,750
were their three favorite phrases.

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,300
I think you can lean on your parents more.

172
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,010
I...

173
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,350
She said she'll come pick up Hayate once she's home.

174
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,560
That's great.

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,320
While I was at the hospital with
Makinohara-san, the middle schooler,

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,400
were you still in this apartment
all by yourself, Shouko-san?

177
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,160
Gee, who can say?

178
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,370
Nobody observed me,
so my existence was uncertain.

179
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,790
I'm Schrödinger's Shouko-san, huh?

180
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,630
Your Puberty Syndrome...

181
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,250
Is it related to your illness?

182
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,510
Yes, probably.

183
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,220
I have a heart disease.

184
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,720
Back in elementary school,

185
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,850
doctors said I might not live
to graduate middle school.

186
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,070
So even just growing up was a dream of mine.

187
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,700
Going to high school, going to college,

188
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,010
becoming an adult...

189
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,790
My younger self lives with those dreams,

190
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,120
and I'm probably the future self she envisioned.

191
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,290
Onee-chan...

192
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,710
How long are you gonna be staying there?

193
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,010
A little while longer.

194
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,970
I'll call again later.

195
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,970
After hearing her story,
I don't know what to do anymore.

196
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,140
Well, either way,

197
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll make another trip
to the hospital tomorrow.

198
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,310
Thanks, Sakuta.

199
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,600
I'll see if I can bring Futaba, too. I've got this.

200
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,730
December 10th

201
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,190
To confirm one thing,

202
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,160
the middle schooler, Shouko-chan,
doesn't know she grows up sometimes, right?

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,370
Shouko-san said she's never met Makinohara-san,

204
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,290
so she probably doesn't know.

205
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,590
Plans for the Future

206
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,590
Name:

207
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,590
...........Makinohara Shouko

- Meet the boy of my dreams
- Graduate high school in good health!

208
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,590
Come in.

209
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,880
How are you feeling?

210
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
Sakuta-san! Thank you for coming!

211
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,140
I brought Futaba with me, too.

212
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,180
Hello.

213
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,760
Hello!

214
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,390
Is it all right for us to drop by without notice?

215
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,100
It's perfectly fine! I'm happy you came!

216
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,560
Thank goodness.

217
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,980
Were you studying?

218
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,440
Not exactly.
Actually, you came at just the right time.

219
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,400
I need your help with something.

220
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,540
Plans for the Future

221
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,540
Name:

222
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,540
...........Makinohara Shouko
- Graduate elementary school
- Graduate middle school
- Go to a high school with an ocean view!
- Meet the boy of my dreams
- Graduate high school in good health!

223
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
"Plans for the Future"?

224
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
What about it?

225
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,540
We got this worksheet in fourth grade.

226
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,290
I didn't tell you the other day,
but because of my condition,

227
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:03,010
I need a heart transplant or I may not live
to graduate middle school.

228
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,970
A heart transplant?

229
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,140
So when we got the worksheet,

230
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,720
I had a lot I wanted to write,

231
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,770
but I just couldn't imagine life
beyond middle school.

232
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,770
Plans for the Future

233
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,770
Name:

234
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,770
...........Makinohara Shouko
- Graduate elementary school
- Graduate middle school

235
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,690
I thought I'd write about it someday,

236
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,570
but I just couldn't.

237
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,280
In the end, I graduated elementary school
with this assignment still unfinished.

238
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,410
But isn't this your handwriting?

239
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,950
- Graduate elementary school
- Graduate middle school
- Go to a high school with an ocean view!
- Meet the boy of my dreams
- Graduate high school in good health!

240
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,950
It is, but I didn't write any of it.

241
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,710
Maybe you just forgot?

242
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,080
When I last saw it before my hospitalization,

243
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,290
it was still unfinished.

244
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,380
Well, that's mysterious.

245
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,590
Is this what you wanted to write back then?

246
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,430
Not quite.

247
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,760
If anything, it's what I want to write now.

248
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,970
How would you continue it, then?

249
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,690
First I'd like to go to college.

250
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,770
Then I'd love to have a cool boyfriend.

251
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,520
And then we would live together,

252
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,820
and it'd be the best if we got married.

253
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,360
You want to get married as a student?

254
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,320
Yeah. That's what my parents did.

255
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,490
Can I take a photo of this?

256
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,120
Go ahead.

257
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,450
I'll give it some thought.

258
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,000
As of now, I would say the older Shouko-san is here

259
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:28,880
to carry out the plans the younger Shouko-chan
couldn't write down in elementary school.

260
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,260
Or to experience a future she may not live to see.

261
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,010
Organ Donor Card

262
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,140
Organ Donor Card

263
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,270
Organ Donor Card

264
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,980
Organ Donor Card

265
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,980
This is about all I can do for her right now.

266
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,190
So, what are you planning to do about it?

267
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,450
About what?

268
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,820
Getting married to Shouko-san.

269
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,030
Hang on! How'd you even get to that?!

270
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,120
Doesn't the "boy of her dreams"
in her plans refer to you?

271
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,670
She met you as a high schooler
two years ago, no?

272
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,590
Which means this Shouko-san
is the college-student version,

273
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,300
here to get married to you.

274
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,430
Fujisawa General Hospital

275
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,430
December 11th

276
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,440
I'm coming in.

277
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,100
Please do!

278
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,770
Am I disturbing anything?

279
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,230
Not at all. Thank you for coming again.

280
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,820
You got a tree, huh?

281
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,530
Yes.

282
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,990
But I'd like to be discharged before Christmas.

283
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,870
I want to go see the Enoshima lights again.

284
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,250
The Enoshima lights, huh?

285
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,460
They're super pretty!

286
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,750
Are you going with Mai-san?

287
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,260
She doesn't know her work schedule yet.

288
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,510
She must be really busy, huh?

289
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,350
Then, um, would you like to go with me?

290
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,140
With you?

291
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,390
I-It doesn't have to be on Christmas.

292
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,440
We could invite Rio-san and Kaede-san,

293
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,110
and go as a group.

294
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,780
We can do it to celebrate your discharge from the hospital.

295
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah! I can't wait!

296
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,820
Oh right, Sakuta-san.

297
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,410
- Graduate elementary school
- Graduate middle school
- Go to a high school with an ocean view!
- Meet the boy of my dreams
- Graduate high school in good health!
- Get admitted to college
- Be reunited with the boy of my dreams
- Tell him how I feel

298
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,410
About these plans...

299
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,120
There are more of them now.

300
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,250
Yes, there are.

301
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,750
I love Sakuta-kun, after all.

302
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,880
Am I really gonna have to marry her?

303
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,470
December 12th

304
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,180
How's your temperature?

305
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,010
Pretty high. Where's Mai-san?

306
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,180
She went out. She has work today.

307
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,940
Hey, Shouko-san.

308
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,060
What is it?

309
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,030
Are you the same person I met at
Shichirigahama Beach two years ago?

310
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,160
You were such a difficult boy back then.

311
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,240
Thank you for everything you did.

312
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,580
Come on. Sleep in your bed.

313
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,420
You saved me, Shouko-san.

314
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,380
It's the other way around.

315
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,800
You saved me, Sakuta-kun.

316
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,510
Sakuta-kun,

317
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,180
what words or phrases make you happy to hear?

318
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,480
For me, it's...

319
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,810
"thank you," "you did well," and "I love you."

320
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,690
They're my three favorite phrases.

321
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,320
You did well, Sakuta-kun.

322
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Shouko-san?

323
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,580
Sorry it's just me.

324
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,290
U-Uh...

325
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,880
You can save your excuses
for when you're better.

326
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,340
I know Shouko-san took care of you all day.

327
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,430
Do you feel any better?

328
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,260
Better than this morning.

329
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,010
A bath might be too much right now,

330
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,390
but at least get changed.

331
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,140
Come on.

332
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,480
It's fine! I can do it myself!

333
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,440
I don't want you to catch what I've got.

334
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,900
Let me do girlfriend things for once!

335
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,690
Sakuta, is this...

336
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,530
They reopened the last time Shouko-san showed up.

337
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,660
And now they're like this.

338
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,790
Doesn't it hurt?

339
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,620
Not anymore.

340
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,040
That's a form of Puberty Syndrome too, isn't it?

341
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,330
Probably.

342
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,830
December 13th

343
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,050
Futaba, you in?

344
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,130
Yes, sure.

345
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,220
He just showed up, so I'll put him on.

346
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,890
Didn't I tell you not to drag me into this?

347
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,890
Huh?

348
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,140
Hello?

349
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,850
Is this Sakuta-kun?

350
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,980
What is it?

351
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,650
Futaba Rio

352
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,690
You're going on a date with me today.

353
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,650
I'd really rather not.

354
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,360
Are you that scared of Mai-san?

355
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,900
Absolutely.

356
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,490
But this date will help her too.

357
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,570
Will it resolve your Puberty Syndrome if I go?

358
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,160
Will you pass on in peace?

359
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
That's right.

360
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,790
If you're lying, I'll be mad.

361
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,460
1 PM, at the Shichirigahama Beach parking lot.

362
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,840
Got it.

363
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,300
See you then.

364
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,760
I'll tell Mai-san myself, so keep quiet.

365
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,640
How does Shouko-san see herself?

366
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,430
As the future self Makinohara-san dreamed of, right?

367
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,100
Shouko-san's old enough to be in college, right?

368
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,570
What about her memories of the six or so years from now to then?

369
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,650
Maybe she doesn't have any?

370
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,400
If my hypothesis is correct,

371
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,620
Shouko-san's hiding something huge from you.

372
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,120
I think she's...

373
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,880
Are you okay to be out like this?

374
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,180
All systems green. I'm in the pink of health.

375
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,890
I didn't ask for color commentary.

376
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm just trying to make this a fun date!

377
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,600
But... Thank you for your concern.

378
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,070
Are you familiar with this area?

379
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,570
Kind of, yes.

380
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,450
Seriously, where are we going?

381
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,450
Right here!

382
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,710
I haven't an inklin' what this is.

383
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,380
Thank you for signing up for a trial visit.

384
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,800
Please come this way.

385
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,100
Come on in.

386
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,310
Would you like to try on a wedding dress?

387
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,770
That might be a bit much.

388
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,650
Nah, just try one on.

389
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,860
But...

390
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,860
Can we do that?

391
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,990
Of course. Please follow me.

392
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,420
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

393
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,470
Your mouth's wide open, you know?

394
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,300
You just look so beautiful
that it made my jaw drop.

395
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,680
Then it was worth all the time
picking out the best one to show you.

396
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,600
Please take your time.

397
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,360
Think you'll be satisfied with a free trial?

398
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,820
We'll have to ask my younger self.

399
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,030
But you already know the answer, don't you?

400
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,870
That scar on your chest...

401
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,660
You managed to get a transplant, huh?

402
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,960
Yeah.

403
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,340
You're from the future, aren't you?

404
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,510
Are you mad?

405
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,720
Not really.

406
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,090
I'm more relieved than anything.

407
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,180
I'm just so glad Makinohara-san gets the transplant she needs.

408
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,810
Yes, my younger self will get it soon,

409
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,100
curing her heart disease.

410
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,070
The Puberty Syndrome will be gone after Christmas too.

411
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,320
Then...

412
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,410
I can only be with you until Christmas.

413
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,290
So would you give me one last memory to take with me?

414
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,870
Like what?

415
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,170
A memory of my first love.

416
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,170
I don't see why you would fall for me.

417
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,590
Though I had many reasons to fall for you.

418
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,520
You were the one who helped me adopt Hayate.

419
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,020
But that's nothing.

420
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,480
When I kept telling my parents "I'm sorry,"

421
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,820
you helped me realize that I should have been saying "thank you" and "I love you" instead.

422
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,200
When I was on my hospital bed, all worried,

423
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,870
you were the one who came to see me every day.

424
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,420
My first love ended unspoken,
but it remains in my heart.

425
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,880
So you'd better take responsibility.

426
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,550
How do I do that?

427
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,800
The night of Christmas Eve,

428
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
go see the Enoshima lights with me.

429
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,970
But...

430
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,100
Oh, Kaede-chan?

431
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,890
She'll be going to stay at your grandparents' on the 23rd.

432
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,060
This is the first I've heard of that.

433
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,020
Besides...

434
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,480
Mai-san will be free in the evening.

435
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,700
Decide whether you'll spend Christmas Eve
with me or with Mai-san.

436
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,610
Shouko-san, I...

437
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,200
You don't have to say it.

438
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,330
But I'll still be waiting.

439
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,620
At 6 PM, December 24th,

440
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,290
I'll be waiting by the dragon torch on Benten Bridge.

441
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,750
How did the date go?

442
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,450
You were right.

443
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,670
She had a surgical scar on her chest.

444
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,180
You saw her chest, huh?

445
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,890
I didn't undress her or anything, okay?

446
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,680
How did she come here from the future, anyway?

447
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,770
Rather than coming from the future,

448
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,360
it might be better to say she reached it.

449
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,440
Reached the future?

450
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,690
When I went to see her last,

451
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,280
Shouko-chan was unusually
vocal about her worries.

452
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,410
She wished her body would
stop growing altogether.

453
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,620
But she told me she wants her parents
to see her all grown up.

454
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,250
There's a Shouko-chan who wants to grow up,

455
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,290
and one who rejected it.

456
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,130
That split may be the cause
of her Puberty Syndrome.

457
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,930
What do you mean?

458
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,930
The one who rejected growing up

459
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,250
desperately tried to stop time for herself.

460
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,270
As a result,

461
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,560
the world slowed down in her eyes,

462
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,190
as though everything were in slow motion.

463
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:19,740
If it were observed from this world, where we
and the Shouko-chan who wants to grow up are,

464
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,870
what do you think would happen?

465
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,500
Quantum mechanics, my favorite subject.

466
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,670
Wrong.

467
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,510
We're talking about the theory of relativity.

468
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:38,050
Like returning from the Sea Dragon's Palace
to find that decades have passed on the surface.

469
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,930
So Shouko-san is Urashima Tarou now?

470
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,220
That's right.

471
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,390
As time flowed faster for her in our world,

472
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,060
she reached the future before us.

473
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,690
I'm home.

474
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,320
Oh, welcome back, Onii-chan.

475
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah, he just got back.

476
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,410
Okay, got it. Later.

477
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,540
Who was that?

478
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,620
Dad.

479
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,210
Said Grandpa and Grandma want to see me.

480
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,010
Mai-san called earlier, too.

481
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,630
She wants you to meet her at the station at 9 PM.

482
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,760
Sounds like she has something to talk to you about.

483
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,140
And what's that?

484
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,470
Keep what I said today a secret, okay?

485
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,690
It would really suck if the future changed in some way that prevented my surgery.

486
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,020
The movie shoot's going pretty well,

487
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,240
so I'm free in the evening as of now.

488
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
Huh?

489
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
On the 24th.

490
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,990
Let's go on a date.

491
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,120
Do you want to go see the Enoshima lights?

492
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,710
I'd rather see the aquarium jellyfish.

493
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,590
The ones on that new train ad?

494
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,590
Yeah, those.

495
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,300
Seeing that ad every day made me curious.

496
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,470
I didn't know you liked jellyfish.

497
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,060
If I see them with you, I will.

498
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,100
I see.

499
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,140
Then I'll head there directly from the shoot.

500
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,190
Does 6 PM at the aquarium sound okay?

501
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,400
Perfect.

502
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,480
December 14th

503
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,950
Senpai, did something nice happen?

504
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,530
You've got this smirk on your face.

505
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,450
Actually, did something happen to you?

506
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,990
Huh? Why do you ask?

507
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,830
Your upper arm's looking flabbier.

508
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,040
You're such a jerk! Now I'm steamin'!

509
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,000
Sorry I'm late.

510
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Don't be.

511
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,130
I'll come earlier tomorrow.

512
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,720
- Go to a high school with an ocean view!
- Meet the boy of my dreams
- Graduate high school in good health!
- Get admitted to college
- Be reunited with the boy of my dreams
- Tell him how I feel
- Arrange an important Christmas Eve date

513
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
There's another item now.

514
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,350
Yeah...

515
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,730
Um, Sakuta-san.

516
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,190
My illness isn't getting any better.

517
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,150
The drugs are keeping me going for now,

518
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,950
but they won't work forever either.

519
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,780
Really?

520
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,120
Yeah, so...

521
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,080
You can stop visiting me.

522
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,040
Hell no.

523
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,330
I'll come tomorrow and the day after.

524
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,590
While I'll have to skip some days for work,

525
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,760
I'll come every day until you're discharged.

526
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,640
But I...

527
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,350
I...

528
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,520
You did well, Makinohara-san.

529
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,150
You fought really hard.

530
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,400
Sakuta-san, it's not like I...

531
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,870
It's not like I wanted to be sick!

532
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,710
Why me? I want to live like everyone else!

533
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,750
I want to live... Live on...

534
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,590
And then...

535
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,920
You've fought harder than anyone every day.

536
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,720
But you don't have to fight alone anymore.

537
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,180
I'll come tomorrow and the day after.

538
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,350
I promise.

539
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,690
Really?

540
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,780
Makinohara-san?

541
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,860
Makinohara-san!

542
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,740
Her condition has worsened.

543
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,740
Shouko-chan.

544
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,610
Check the operation room!

545
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,610
Shouko-chan.

546
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,780
Get the ICU ready, too!

547
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,490
Shouko-chan. It'll be all right.

548
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,490
How are her vitals?

549
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,910
Blood pressure is 72 over 45, pulse 110.

550
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,910
Ouch!

551
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,290
What's going on?

552
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,380
Why now?!

553
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,260
Could it be that...

554
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,720
my...

555
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,690
Your heart's racing right now, isn't it?

556
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,070
Please don't get me worked up.

557
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,320
Same here. Whenever I'm with you,

558
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,530
my heart skips a beat.

559
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,320
Stop it.

560
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,780
My wounds will reopen.

561
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,870
Don't worry. You'll heal for sure.

562
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,870
The wounds in your heart,

563
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,540
and the wounds on your chest...

564
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,750
I'll heal them for you.

565
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,630
I promise.

566
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,720
Sakuta-kun.

567
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,270
Shouko-san.

568
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,850
They called and said you'd suddenly collapsed.

569
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,890
I was so shocked.

570
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,110
I just had a dream.

571
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,610
Of around the time we first met.

572
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,860
I see.

573
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,700
It happened back then too.

574
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,790
That was around when I got these wounds.

575
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,580
Tell me, Shouko-san.

576
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,500
You have my heart now, don't you?

577
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,130
I should've known you would realize.

578
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,680
You gave me a future.

579
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,730
What...

580
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,640
are you talking about?

581
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,490
It happens in ten days, on December 24th.

582
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,450
It starts snowing that afternoon.

583
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,740
On the way to meeting you for your date,

584
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,710
Sakuta-kun gets in a traffic accident.

585
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,960
How would you know that?

586
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,040
I'm from the future.

587
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,170
It's true.

588
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,130
He gets rushed to the hospital,

589
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,090
but never regains consciousness.

590
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,100
Eventually, he is declared brain dead.

591
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,640
Later, they find a donor card on him,

592
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,690
and I miraculously get a heart transplant.

593
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,150
I see.

594
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,900
I only learned the truth after the surgery.

595
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,200
I tried to tell Sakuta-kun about it,

596
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,910
and that's when Mai-san told me everything.

597
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,250
So please have your date at home this Christmas.

598
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,040
But that means...

599
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,670
Don't worry.

600
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,010
My younger self still has time.

601
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,010
Have some faith in modern medicine.

602
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,300
Now, it'd be dangerous for me
to stay in this hospital too long,

603
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,930
so I'll be on my way.

604
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,930
Mai-san.

605
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,810
Please take care of Sakuta-kun for me.

606
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,610
I wish it was all a lie.

607
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,990
Hey, Mai-san...

608
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,700
I'm not going to break up with you.

609
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,290
We'll have to change plans
for our Christmas Eve date.

610
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,420
Nodoka will be out for a concert,

611
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,050
so we can spend it at my place.

612
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,300
And we'll go on a New Year's shrine visit.

613
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,050
But it'll be too crowded on New Year's Day,

614
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,220
so we can go toward the end of winter break.

615
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,180
Right.

616
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,810
I'll make you chocolate for Valentine's Day.

617
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,440
And I'll be graduating in spring,

618
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,610
but I'll still tutor you, so be ready.

619
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,740
A year later, we'll be attending the same college.

620
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,370
I'm saying...

621
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,330
I want you to choose a future with me.

622
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,250
I'm begging you.

623
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,960
I'll go back to my place tonight.

624
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Okay.

625
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,710
See you. Good night.

626
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,920
Good night.

627
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
December 18th

628
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,270
What happened to club?

629
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,730
I saw you leaving, so I decided to skip today.

630
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,520
Are you going to confess your love to me?

631
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,240
Azusagawa, have you been avoiding me lately?

632
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,070
You're imagining it.

633
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,870
I know that you collapsed on Sunday.

634
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,830
And that Shouko-chan had to go to the ICU.

635
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,960
I went to the hospital yesterday.

636
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,130
I see. So you've realized already.

637
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,250
I'd always considered the possibility.

638
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,710
Anytime anything happened with your wounds,

639
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,260
it was always when Shouko-san showed up.

640
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,720
You're amazing.

641
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,510
Shouko-chan and Shouko-san can probably never meet.

642
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,230
But you ended up meeting Shouko-san,

643
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,520
even though you both share one part.

644
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,860
It's because there are two of your heart, which shouldn't be possible,

645
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,820
that you got those wounds on your chest, right?

646
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,240
I get hit by a car on the 24th, apparently.

647
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,120
Does Sakurajima-senpai know?

648
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,420
Yeah. She found out when I did.

649
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,920
I can only give you banal advice like this,

650
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,210
but you two should talk things out.

651
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,180
Yeah, you're right.

652
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,800
Azusagawa...

653
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,010
I...

654
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,480
I don't want this.

655
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,940
Are you making progress on your exam prep?

656
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,150
Sakurajima Mai

657
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,150
You haven't been tutoring me as a bunny girl,
so I'm not getting anywhere.

658
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,120
If I did that, you wouldn't get anywhere for other reasons.

659
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,290
Oh, but I would get off, at least.

660
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,830
Idiot.

661
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,210
Uh, Mai-san...

662
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,120
Oh right, about Kaede-chan.

663
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,960
She wants a haircut before leaving for your grandparents', right?

664
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,340
Yeah.

665
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,930
I know a stylist in Chigasaki.

666
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,470
Want to go?

667
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,970
Really?

668
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,970
I can go with you Sunday afternoon,

669
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,970
so ask Kaede-chan for me.

670
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,180
Got it.

671
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,690
By the way...

672
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,110
Oh, break time's over.

673
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,690
I'll call again tomorrow.

674
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,070
Bye.

675
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,740
December 21st

676
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,740
It might look nice if we cut some more here.

677
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,580
Yeah.

678
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,790
Why are you here, Toyohama?

679
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,830
I have an appointment today too.

680
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,790
Problem?

681
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,250
That aside, let's talk the 24th.

682
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,210
I'll be coming straight home from the concert.

683
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,590
Don't worry. I'll save some cake for you.

684
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,090
That's not what I'm worried about.

685
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,340
You want chicken?

686
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,260
You're so lucky, Sakuta.

687
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,560
Where'd that come from?

688
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,980
I mean, Onee-chan is so excited
to spend Christmas with you.

689
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,190
Wondering what to cook, where to get cake,

690
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,650
and what to wear.

691
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,530
That's so cute, even just imagining it.

692
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,410
If you make her cry, you'll have hell to pay.

693
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,700
All done.

694
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,370
H-How do I look?

695
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,710
Very nice.

696
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,670
It doesn't look like I'm trying too hard?

697
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,760
An actual tryhard looks more like this.

698
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,550
I am not!

699
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,520
Nodoka, can you please take Kaede-chan home?

700
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,770
What about you?

701
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,940
Sakuta and I have somewhere to go.

702
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,400
Kaede, can you get home without me?

703
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,110
How old do you think I am, Onii-chan?

704
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,660
Then I guess you'll be fine.

705
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,740
I'm happy you're more independent now.

706
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,660
Is that a dig at me?

707
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,040
You do your best as a sister-loving idol.

708
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,290
Take care of Mai-san.

709
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,420
Huh? What's up with that?

710
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,300
So, where are we going, Mai-san?

711
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,100
This takes me back.

712
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,230
We went to Ogaki together, remember?

713
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,440
It's already been six months, huh?

714
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,020
Which train will take us the farthest?

715
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,610
Where do you even want to go?

716
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,780
As far away as possible.

717
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,780
We'll keep changing trains and go
even farther than we did that day.

718
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,280
We can only go as far as Ogaki this late.

719
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,750
If the trains stop, we can stay overnight in some random city.

720
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,330
And get a hotel room together?

721
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,330
If that's what you want.

722
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,790
Wow, it's like a dream come true.

723
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,170
In the morning, we'll set off again.

724
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,090
We'll go far away together.

725
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,630
Far, far away.

726
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,930
That sounds really fun.

727
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,850
But you're kidding, right?

728
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,520
No, you...

729
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,190
You're the one who needs to stop kidding around!

730
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,400
Don't talk to Nodoka and Kaede-chan as though you were saying goodbye!

731
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,610
What is wrong with you?!

732
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,110
Don't go giving up!
Don't decide everything on your own!

733
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,660
What am I to you?

734
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,780
My girlfriend.

735
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,250
So let me bear the weight
of Shouko-chan's life with you.

736
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,420
I'll share the pain of choosing to live on,

737
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,250
so please, stay with me!

738
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,380
Stay with me until Christmas is over!

739
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,430
Let's take a train and go as far away as we can!

740
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,550
I'm sure that'd be fun, but I can't.

741
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,640
Why not?

742
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,390
We have school tomorrow.

743
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,520
Take the day off!

744
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,440
You have work tomorrow, too.

745
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,400
I don't care about work!

746
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,230
Not if it means losing you!

747
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,280
I love you, Mai-san.

748
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,030
It sucked that you were too busy
to go on many dates,

749
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,250
but that's who I want to be with.

750
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,290
That's the Mai-san I fell in love with.

751
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,000
Fine.

752
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,550
I won't even care if you come to hate me,
as long as it means you live on.

753
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,010
Just stay with me until Christmas!

754
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,390
You can hate me all you want after that!

755
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,510
That's impossible.

756
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,180
Why?!

757
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,270
I could never come to hate you.

758
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,900
Why...

759
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,190
Why?

760
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,490
I'll always love you.

761
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,370
Liar.

762
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,280
I promise I'll love you always and forever.

763
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,160
You're a liar.

764
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,330
But I'm a liar too.

765
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:29,420
I don't... I don't want you to hate me!

766
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,110
Welcome back, Sakuta-kun.

767
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,400
Did Mai-san go back to her place again?

768
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,570
Yeah.

769
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,190
Where's Kaede?

770
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,780
Already asleep.

771
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,780
Shouko-san, I...

772
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,290
I never wanted to see Mai-san cry like that.

773
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,750
I never want to make her cry like that again.

774
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,920
So hey, Shouko-san...

775
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,470
Yes, what is it?

776
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,180
I'm really sorry.

777
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,220
I want to live on.

778
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,640
I want to be with Mai-san always and forever.

779
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,730
I'm the one who should apologize.

780
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,400
Sorry for forcing such a painful decision on you.

781
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,740
If I'd handled things better,

782
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,410
you wouldn't have had to feel this pain.

783
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,570
But that's not...

784
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,950
It's not your fault. You did well.

785
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,830
I...

786
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,920
You did well to get it out.

787
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,460
Just be sure to make Mai-san happy.

788
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,810
December 24th

789
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,690
Our happy, exciting live-in life together ends today.

790
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,870
Shouko-san...

791
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,490
Have a nice day.

792
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,210
See you.

793
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,470
What was this year like for all of you?

794
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,090
Isn't it cold today?

795
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,180
Freezing.

796
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,050
It's crazy.

797
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,140
Sakuta-kun.

798
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:57,730
Shouko-chan's mother wants her to see you.

799
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,030
Thank you so much.

800
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,280
Don't mention it.

801
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,640
You did well, Sakuta-kun.

802
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,890
You did well.

803
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,390
She's so amazing.

804
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,150
Makinohara-san's still fighting, even now.

805
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,450
It's me. Mai-san, I...

806
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,450
I had a dream last night.

807
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,540
A dream of us going on a New Year's shrine visit.

808
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,170
You said you told God you'd make me happy.

809
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,210
That sounds like me, all right.

810
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,380
Seriously, it's so like you to lie even in my dreams.

811
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,220
I will never forget you.

812
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,390
I will live life with you.

813
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,230
Mai-san, I...

814
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,210
Why?

815
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,840
Does it happen on the next red light?

816
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,720
Check out the Sea Candle! It's so pretty!

817
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,020
Do you want to go see the Enoshima lights?

818
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,150
Go see the Enoshima lights with me.

819
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,360
Wait...

820
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,110
Did Shouko-san know from the start?

821
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,120
She's nuts!

822
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,250
What is wrong with her?!

823
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,870
She knew I'd choose Mai-san all along!

824
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,790
That's why she...

825
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,250
At 6 PM, December 24th,

826
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:07,220
I'll be waiting by the dragon torch on Benten Bridge.

827
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,800
She chose it because she knew
that was the one place I'd never go!

828
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:14,890
The Puberty Syndrome will be gone after Christmas too.

829
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,390
If I'd handled things better...

830
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,810
Have a nice day.

831
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,440
What the hell?!

832
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,400
You're not right in the head, Shouko-san!

833
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,110
Watch out, asshole!

834
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,410
I can't let things end like this!

835
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,740
Please let me make it!

836
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,960
Sakuta-kun!

837
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,010
Sakuta!

838
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,570
Ow...

839
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,270
Is my daughter... Is Mai really...

840
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,400
We did all we could.

841
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,690
I'm so sorry.

842
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,910
No, Mai...

843
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,830
Give Mai back!

844
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,620
Give her back!

845
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,850
Why?

846
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,440
Why?!

847
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,150
Why didn't you keep her safe?!

848
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,450
Why... Tell me why...

849
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,080
Sorry.

850
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,580
I'm sorry.

851
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,540
I should've been the one to die.

852
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,310
Oh, of course.

853
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,860
I didn't die, so Shouko-san never...

854
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,700
I couldn't do anything.

855
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:41,510
December 25th

856
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,630
It's unlocked.

857
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,510
Sakuta, you here? We're coming in.

858
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,310
Sakuta!

859
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,020
We saw the accident on the news.

860
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,650
We called you a bunch of times.

861
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,570
Sorry to have worried you.

862
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,490
You have four messages.

863
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,870
First, 7:03 AM.

864
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,580
Onii-chan... It's not true, right?

865
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,500
Please tell me that didn't happen to Mai-san!

866
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,250
Let me. Sakuta, call us when you get this.

867
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,510
You can call your family on the move.

868
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,630
Let's go, Sakuta.

869
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,390
Where?

870
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,810
Pictures and videos of the accident are doing the rounds online.

871
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,310
Some of them have your face showing.

872
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,020
I see.

873
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,520
Stay with me for a while.

874
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,150
The media will be all over this place.

875
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,570
Funeral Service
for Sakurajima Mai

876
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,750
December 28th

877
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,750
Reporting live from the funeral.

878
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,380
Amidst this afternoon's rain,

879
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:58,090
Live Report from Sakurajima Mai's Funeral Service

880
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,260
Sakurajima Mai-san's funeral service continues.

881
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,340
As I'm sure many of you are aware,

882
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,340
Taken from Us Far Too Soon...
Sakurajima Mai's Funeral Service

883
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,220
four days ago, on December 24th,

884
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,890
actress Sakurajima Mai-san
passed away in an accident.

885
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,350
It's such a tragedy.
I met her just the day before...

886
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,820
I've never dated before,
so I'm nervous about it all.

887
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,160
But surely you have the boy
wrapped around your little finger.

888
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:31,080
Sakurajima Mai's
Sudden Farewell

889
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,570
What do you take me for?

890
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,910
Well, I do have him whipped.

891
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:27,910
Of course!

892
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,080
But I probably love him
more than he loves me.

893
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,920
Huh? Are you sure you
should be saying that?

894
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,500
He could be watching, you know?

895
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,810
Help...

896
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,230
Help.

897
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,900
Someone please save Mai-san.

898
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,580
I don't care who.

899
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,180
Save Mai-san...

900
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,260
Please.

901
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,020
Please, I beg you!

902
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,560
Get up, Sakuta-kun.

903
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,280
It's your job to save Mai-san.

904
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,410
Am I wrong?

905
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,540
Why are you here, Shouko-san?

906
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,870
Oh, you don't know yet, do you?

907
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,420
I have Mai-san's heart right here.

908
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,760
It wasn't made public,

909
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,720
but Mai-san became my donor after the accident.

910
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,600
She had a donor card too?

911
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,390
Yes.

912
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,890
But then... The future changed?

913
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,690
Let's go save Mai-san.

914
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,480
Go where?

915
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,110
To the past, of course.

916
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,530
But that's...

917
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,820
It's possible.

918
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,990
Trust me.

919
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,500
You don't have to worry.

920
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,290
It's Mai-san's funeral today, so nobody's here.

921
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,130
Why the infirmary?

922
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,170
You need a bed to go back to the past.

923
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,430
Shouko-san, what's this?

924
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,270
Plum soda for grownups.

925
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:01,980
You already know that the future is all around us

926
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,570
and that I came from the future, yes?

927
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:09,200
Your Puberty Syndrome caused that, right?

928
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
Right.

929
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,620
My younger self developed Puberty Syndrome

930
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,620
out of anxiety for her future.

931
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:22,250
But this moment, with us talking right here,

932
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,880
isn't exactly the present.

933
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,130
And you're the reason why.

934
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,340
Does that not ring a bell?

935
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:36,600
Did you ever reject the future
like my younger self?

936
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,520
I want you to choose a future with me.

937
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,810
Why...

938
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,270
I want to live on.

939
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,820
Seems like it does ring a bell.

940
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,400
Well...

941
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,320
There's something you have to accept:

942
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,160
the weak part of yourself
that rejected the future.

943
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:03,040
Believing in that weakness is the first step
toward recognizing this as the future.

944
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,710
And if this is the future,

945
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,970
you can go back to the present
and save Mai-san.

946
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,090
Shouko-san.

947
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,640
What is it?

948
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,100
I want to make Mai-san happy.

949
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:18,930
And you can.

950
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:23,190
So there's something I have to tell you.

951
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,570
I want you to live.

952
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:27,900
Right.

953
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,360
I'm hoping and praying for it.

954
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,030
I know.

955
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,780
But I'm not a doctor,
and I don't have superpowers.

956
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,370
I have my hands full
just keeping Mai-san happy.

957
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,040
But I failed to do even that.

958
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,630
So... Listen, Shouko-san.

959
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,460
Yes?

960
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,430
I can't do anything for you.

961
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,700
You're fine that way.

962
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,900
Why am I crying?

963
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,520
I already made up my mind.

964
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,280
Shouko-san...

965
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:13,900
Huh?

966
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,830
Looks like the drug finally kicked in.

967
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,000
To go to the present,

968
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,750
we need to get rid of the common sense
that binds you to now.

969
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:33,130
And people can only abandon
common sense in their dreams.

970
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,380
Shouko-san...

971
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,600
Don't worry about me.

972
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,310
Once you're back in the present,

973
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,640
start by looking for someone who will find you.

974
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,940
Good night, Sakuta-kun.

975
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,910
M

976
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,910
D

977
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,790
Did I really make it back?

978
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,590
Doc, he jammed his finger.

979
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:12,460
Kunimi?

980
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,510
Take a seat. I'll ice it.

981
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,090
Oww!

982
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:17,590
Hey, Kunimi!

983
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,310
What's going on?

984
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,850
Start by looking for someone who will find you.

985
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,690
Quantum mechanics in action, huh?

986
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,480
I'm straddling the present and future right now.

987
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,900
Until someone finds me,
my existence will be uncertain.

988
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,370
December 24th

989
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,660
Futaba!

990
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,370
Hey, Futaba! Notice me!

991
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,460
Futaba!

992
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
Past

993
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
Present

994
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
Future

995
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
Azusagawa A

996
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
Azusagawa B

997
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
Azusagawa C

998
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,130
Thanks.

999
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,050
I'm borrowing this.

1000
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,600
Huh?

1001
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,800
Damn, I can't use it?

1002
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,180
This is already a disaster!

1003
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,980
I could use Mai-san's idea.

1004
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,980
Can anyone see me?!

1005
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,650
Anyone will do!

1006
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,950
Is there anyone who can see or hear me?!

1007
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,580
Hey, can you see me?

1008
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,620
Look at me!

1009
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,710
I wanna save Mai-san!

1010
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,960
Please!

1011
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,840
Someone find me...

1012
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,930
Please find me...

1013
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,350
I'm begging you.

1014
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,860
What are you doing, Senpai?

1015
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,320
Koga?

1016
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,820
Y-You can see me?

1017
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,320
Of course I see you.
Are you all right in the head?

1018
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,410
I-I need to touch you!

1019
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,790
Let me get a feel!

1020
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,910
What the?!

1021
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,580
You see, I had a dream about you last night.

1022
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,830
A dream?

1023
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,920
One where you were at the station
and needed help.

1024
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,920
So I couldn't help myself.
I had to come.

1025
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,430
Quantum entanglement, huh?

1026
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,470
What's that?

1027
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:26,310
Basically, nothing beats
a butt-kicking buddy.

1028
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,470
Come on, you still remember that?

1029
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,520
Koga, I need a favor.

1030
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,900
Huh?

1031
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,020
Wait, wait, wait!

1032
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,600
Timeout!

1033
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,190
Go see my other self.

1034
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,950
Fujisawa General Hospital

1035
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,200
There really is another you over here!

1036
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,160
Put him on.

1037
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,290
You better explain this later!

1038
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,040
Are you really me?

1039
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,330
That's right.

1040
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,960
I came from four days in the future.

1041
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,590
Four days? Then you already...

1042
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:01,630
Yeah. I know what's gonna happen later today.

1043
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,840
That's why I'm here. To change the future.

1044
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,680
Hang on. Did I not get in that accident?

1045
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,190
Mai-san saved me just before I got ran over.

1046
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,150
That's why I'm still alive.

1047
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,230
So stay away from the aquarium.

1048
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:19,900
But...

1049
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,400
If you go, Mai-san will die in your place.

1050
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,240
But if I don't go,
what happens to Makinohara-san?!

1051
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,910
I've made up my mind.

1052
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,450
Aren't you me?
What are you thinking?

1053
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,790
Don't you care what happens
to Makinohara-san?!

1054
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,460
I want to make Mai-san happy.

1055
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,750
I can't do anything for Makinohara-san.

1056
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,500
Are you really me?

1057
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,710
You must be crazy!

1058
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,050
Crazy is fine by me.

1059
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,840
I'm okay with it if I can live
and make Mai-san happy.

1060
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,760
I'd rather get run over
than leave Makinohara-san to die.

1061
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,430
Even if it breaks Mai-san's heart?

1062
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,640
You'd better stop her!

1063
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,940
I'm such a stubborn ass.

1064
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,280
I'm on break right now.
You need something?

1065
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,070
Do you know where Mai-san is?

1066
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,570
TV studio, probably.

1067
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,740
Can you tell me which one?

1068
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,740
I wanna go see her.

1069
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,700
Huh? You can't just
randomly go and see her.

1070
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,160
That's why I need you, Nodoka-sama.

1071
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,920
Please help me. I wanna surprise her.

1072
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,130
Are you messing around?

1073
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,890
Hey, I had to put serious thought into this.

1074
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,850
Well, I guess it does save us some trouble.

1075
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,310
Get in! Quick!

1076
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,480
I'll say you're crew and get you in.

1077
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,270
Thanks!

1078
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,070
You'd better make up with her this time.

1079
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,740
Excuse me.

1080
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,990
You have visitors, Mai-san.

1081
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:54,330
Nodoka?

1082
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,120
Christmas present from me to you.

1083
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,340
Thank you, Nodoka.

1084
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,710
You too, Ryouko-san.

1085
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,800
Sorry for causing you trouble again.

1086
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,590
Can you give us some alone time?

1087
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,520
How long are you going to keep that on?

1088
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,850
You didn't come from the future just for this, right?

1089
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,070
Mai-san...

1090
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:34,660
It's really you.

1091
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,790
You're alive.

1092
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,040
Thank goodness.
I managed to keep you safe, huh?

1093
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,550
I finally got to help you instead.

1094
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,470
You always planned on saving me?

1095
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,470
Didn't I tell you before?

1096
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:56,060
I love you way more than you think.

1097
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,020
Mai-san...

1098
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,060
Let me get a good look.

1099
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,440
You haven't grown all that much.

1100
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,770
Hey, it's only been four days.

1101
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:05,860
Oh...

1102
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:11,070
Sakuta left a voicemail saying he talked to his future self, so I got my hopes up.

1103
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:15,080
I'll grow older eventually. Please be patient.

1104
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,950
I have to go now.

1105
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,000
Sakuta and I have a date.

1106
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,920
Wait, Mai-san!

1107
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,920
Let me go!

1108
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,750
It'll be fine!

1109
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,340
Like hell it will!

1110
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,470
Now that he knows I'll get run over,

1111
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,850
Sakuta will definitely try to sacrifice himself!

1112
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,770
I'm sure he'll think he should be the one to die!

1113
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:44,270
He'd never choose to save himself
if it meant robbing Shouko-chan of her future!

1114
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,860
If I don't go, Sakuta will die!

1115
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,070
Please, just stay here!

1116
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,570
Please!

1117
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:59,120
I never want to lose you again.

1118
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,000
It'll be fine.

1119
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:05,170
I'll do something about myself.

1120
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,880
Are you okay with that?

1121
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,510
My mind's made up. Just wait for me.

1122
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,010
Are you really sure?

1123
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:18,810
Knowing me, I'll come home in tears.

1124
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,850
Give me a hug and console me when I do.

1125
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:25,850
And then I'll make you happy. I promise.

1126
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,820
Got it.

1127
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,860
Thank you, Mai-san.

1128
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,150
But you've got one thing wrong.

1129
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,040
I don't particularly expect you to make me happy.

1130
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:47,630
We'll find happiness together, the two of us.

1131
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,710
You really are the best.

1132
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,470
I'll be waiting for you.

1133
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,200
I'm sorry. Did you wait long?

1134
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,120
I didn't wait. It's not even time yet.

1135
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,660
That's quite the unique outfit
to wear on a date.

1136
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,670
I've worn it all day today.
It's a part of me now.

1137
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,920
I'm sorry. I messed up, didn't I?

1138
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,880
No, you did not.

1139
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,220
I couldn't have come here
from the future without you.

1140
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,180
Let's hold hands, Sakuta-kun.

1141
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,480
This is making me blush a little.

1142
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:02,030
Shouko-san, I'll take everything with me.

1143
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:05,800
The time I spent with you,
my memories of you...

1144
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,420
I'll take all of it to the future with me.

1145
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,340
Sakuta-kun,

1146
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:17,720
why do you think people
forget so many things?

1147
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,380
I'll never forget.

1148
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:24,600
They can't bear to drag around
painful memories forever.

1149
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,350
That's why they forget.

1150
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:30,520
Then I have no reason to forget you.

1151
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,690
Huh?

1152
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:37,820
You were my bittersweet first love.
Those are memories I don't mind keeping.

1153
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,780
You really are such a difficult boy.

1154
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,990
I have to go now.

1155
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,960
Okay.

1156
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,420
Goodbye, Shouko-san.

1157
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,590
Bye-bye, Sakuta-kun.

1158
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,690
The two versions of me can't meet physically.

1159
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:13,480
But turn that around,

1160
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,980
and it means we can coexist
as long as one doesn't recognize the other.

1161
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,080
Sakuta-kun!

1162
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,640
I...

1163
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:52,600
Oh, so that's how it works.

1164
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,060
Are you all right?

1165
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,400
Hey...

1166
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,690
I'm fine.

1167
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:16,040
I just took Makinohara-san's future from her.

1168
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:22,550
But I didn't have any other option.

1169
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,960
I'm home.

1170
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,720
Welcome back.

1171
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:25,400
December 25th

1172
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,200
It's ten o'clock. Wake up.

1173
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,830
I am up.

1174
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:33,660
Eat your breakfast before it goes cold.

1175
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,250
I'm going to school.

1176
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,670
But it's winter break.

1177
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,880
I took the day off for the shoot yesterday,

1178
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,750
so I have to go get my report card.

1179
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,630
I'll go with you, then.

1180
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,090
Futaba.

1181
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,470
Azusagawa...

1182
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,690
H-Hey, you okay?

1183
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,690
No.

1184
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:01,730
Futaba?

1185
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,690
I'm not okay!

1186
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,740
Sorry to have worried you.

1187
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,490
I'm not okay...

1188
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,240
I thought I'd never see you again.

1189
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:16,040
I'm... I'm so glad you're alive.

1190
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,120
What happened yesterday?

1191
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,040
So much that I don't even know where to start.

1192
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,800
Anyway, I did what I had to do.

1193
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:34,140
Senpai, which one are you?

1194
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,560
Both.

1195
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,810
We merged.

1196
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,640
I haven't an inklin' what you mean!

1197
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,810
Sorry I made you worry.

1198
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,110
Thank you so much.

1199
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,990
Here you go. Presents from Grandma.

1200
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,280
She said to give her regards to your girlfriend.

1201
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,490
Oh, I know about these!

1202
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:54,870
They're super yummy, Onee-chan!

1203
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:59,040
Toyohama, you've been extra clingy
with Mai-san today.

1204
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,670
Did your sister obsession get even worse?

1205
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,420
She had a nightmare this morning.

1206
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,670
Apparently, I got in an accident.

1207
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,130
I see. That's understandable.

1208
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:14,140
I hereby allow you to be babied by my Mai-san, today only.

1209
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,220
I don't need your permission.

1210
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,230
Nodoka, I hereby allow you
to step on Sakuta's foot.

1211
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,600
December 26th

1212
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:23,650
Get well soon!

1213
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:23,650
Let's hang out

1214
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:23,650

1596
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,620
I hope Shouko-chan gets better.

1597
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,000
What's the matter?

1598
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Look.

1599
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,460
- Graduate elementary school
- Graduate middle school

1600
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,130
Say, Futaba.

1601
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:55,010
Makinohara-san's Puberty Syndrome isn't gone yet, right?

1602
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:59,640
The one writing and erasing that worksheet

1603
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,060
is the Makinohara-san
in elementary school, isn't it?

1604
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:07,860
The concerns she has for
her future three years ago

1605
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:12,070
are causing her
Puberty Syndrome right now.

1606
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,410
Do you realize what you're saying?

1607
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,410
I'm saying we're in the future,
not the present.

1608
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,960
So in the present...

1609
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,790
If we can help the elementary-school
Makinohara-san,

1610
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:31,550
it'll save the middle-school
version too, won't it?

1611
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,840
That's way harder than
avoiding an accident.

1612
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,680
Doing things over won't make
an illness go away.

1613
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:41,270
You know what Toyohama said?

1614
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,940
She had a dream that
Mai-san got in an accident.

1615
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:49,150
Doesn't that mean other people
can gain those memories?

1616
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,820
I had a similar dream too.

1617
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:55,530
One where I found you dazed
at your place and brought you over.

1618
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:56,280
Then...

1619
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:02,660
But even if you gained these
memories three years ago,

1620
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,250
I don't think it'd change anything.

1621
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,790
You couldn't fix anything. Besides...

1622
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,210
Besides?

1623
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:13,840
If the past changed
and Shouko-chan was cured,

1624
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,550
would you really be happy with that?

1625
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:21,930
If she hadn't developed
Puberty Syndrome in fourth grade,

1626
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:27,060
you never would have met
Shouko-san at Shichirigahama Beach.

1627
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,440
And if you'd never met her,

1628
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:36,030
you never would have come
to Minegahara High or met Kunimi and me.

1629
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:39,070
And you and Sakurajima-senpai
would never have found each other.

1630
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,740
Are you really willing to lose all that?

1631
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,450
Obviously not.

1632
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:44,370
But...

1633
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:50,460
You want to risk everything important to you
on a possibility that may not even exist?

1634
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,010
December 31st

1635
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:04,600
Hello? Azusagawa residence.

1636
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,870
Hello. This is Makinohara.

1637
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:10,230
Makinohara-san's mother?

1638
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:13,860
Um, would you please see Shouko?

1639
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,240
Did something happen?

1640
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,410
The doctors say she doesn't... have long left...

1641
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:46,520
Mai-san, I still want to save Makinohara-san.

1642
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,860
Yeah, I know.

1643
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,900
If that's what you want, I'm okay with it.

1644
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,440
You can change the past if you want.

1645
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:57,280
You can make all of this go away.

1646
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,110
Mai-san...

1647
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:03,200
We promised to find happiness together, remember?

1648
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:08,910
We'll just be taking a little detour to do it.

1649
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:11,120
Right, a little detour.

1650
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,130
We'll just forget everything and start over.

1651
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,920
Yeah, that's all. No big deal.

1652
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,590
Then I'll meet you again...

1653
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,390
Yeah.

1654
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:24,800
Fall in love with you again...

1655
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,010
Yeah.

1656
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:28,310
And you'll ask me out again.

1657
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:35,150
I'll definitely find you again.

1658
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:37,690
And then we're going to find happiness together, okay?

1659
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,780
I promise.

1660
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,410
Fujisawa General Hospital

1661
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:52,790
Shouko, Azusagawa-san is here to see you.

1662
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:04,010
Makinohara-san...

1663
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:08,220
You really kept your promise.

1664
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:14,560
Mom told me that you've come to visit every day.

1665
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,440
Well, I had to skip some days for work.

1666
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,440
Thank you so much.

1667
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:25,110
Hey, about the future plans worksheet we discussed...

1668
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,950
Sakuta-san, I was dreaming all this while.

1669
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,210
It was a magical dream.

1670
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,920
I became a high schooler,

1671
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:42,380
and I consoled and teased you
on Shichirigahama Beach.

1672
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:48,430
I became a college student,
stayed at your place,

1673
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:52,680
and cooked and cleaned for you.

1674
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,400
We even went to a chapel
with an ocean view.

1675
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,610
When I tried on a wedding dress,

1676
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:03,530
you blushed and said I looked beautiful.

1677
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:08,780
Even though it was a dream,
I had so much fun spending time with you.

1678
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,620
It was no dream, Makinohara-san.

1679
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,500
It really was amazing.

1680
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,870
No! It all happened for real!

1681
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,210
I know, Sakuta-kun.

1682
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:25,220
I know everything.

1683
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:28,220
That it was really the future,

1684
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:30,680
and that this is the future too.

1685
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,600
I went and figured it all out.

1686
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,810
Exactly! That's it!

1687
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,600
So if we change the past,

1688
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,480
we could find a way to save you.

1689
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,650
Even if I redo the past,

1690
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:46,950
I don't think I can be cured that easily.

1691
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:54,790
But I can spare you from the pain
you're suffering right now.

1692
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,460
What are you saying?

1693
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,750
I know everything.

1694
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:02,550
I've brought you so much pain, haven't I?

1695
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:06,340
No! You've done nothing wrong!

1696
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:09,930
If I hadn't developed Puberty Syndrome,

1697
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:12,970
you would never have met me.

1698
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:17,140
I've never regretted meeting you for a second!

1699
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,730
You fought so hard for me.

1700
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,940
But it's okay now.

1701
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:30,660
I'll go change the past

1702
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,200
and make sure you never have to meet me.

1703
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:42,420
I'll make sure you reach a future
without all this pain.

1704
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,920
No! You've got it all wrong!

1705
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,260
That's not what I was trying to say!

1706
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,390
You should change the past for yourself!

1707
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:53,890
Leave it all to me.

1708
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:59,140
I promise to make you happy...

1709
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,750
Makinohara-san?

1710
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,480
Makinohara-san?

1711
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,530
How's Shouko-chan?

1712
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,080
She's asleep now.

1713
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,080
I see.

1714
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,000
Look at this, Sakuta.

1715
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,590
Someday, I hope to become
a kinder person
who values the phrases
"thank you," "you did well,"
and "I love you."

1716
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:30,340
What the hell?

1717
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:32,890
Why?

1718
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:35,930
Shouko-chan's mother told me earlier

1719
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:40,390
that she suddenly wanted to finish her assignment yesterday.

1720
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,980
What am I supposed to do?

1721
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,820
How can I help Makinohara-san?

1722
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,530
She knew everything.

1723
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:54,820
She knew about Shouko-san,

1724
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,280
about herself,

1725
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:59,700
and that she could change the past.

1726
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,670
Sorry, Sakuta.

1727
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,840
I can't think of anything else.

1728
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,590
Shouko-chan really did her best.

1729
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:15,680
So put the finishing touch
on her assignment for her.

1730
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:18,640
Praise her for a job well done.

1731
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,520
I...

1732
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,490
Someday, I hope to become
a kinder person
who values the phrases
"thank you," "you did well,"
and "I love you."

1733
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:00,310
Someday, I hope to become
a kinder person
who values the phrases
"thank you," "you did well,"
and "I love you."

1734
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:13,950
It's a new year now, huh?

1735
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,780
Plans for the Future

1736
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,780
- Graduate elementary school
- Graduate middle school
- Learn to bake during high school

1737
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,440
I'm done, Sensei!

1738
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,240
Me too!

1739
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,450
Me three!

1740
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,160
Plans for the Future

1741
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,160

1744
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:52,040
January 6th

1745
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,050
Rise and shine, Onii-chan.

1746
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:02,350
It's still winter break.

1747
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,180
You said you had work from today!

1748
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,640
Are you heading out to
practice going to school?

1749
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,650
I already did.

1750
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:14,190
I still get really nervous,
but I made it to the gate.

1751
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:19,960
Morning.

1752
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,450
Morning.

1753
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,280
Running away from home now?

1754
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,830
I did that already.

1755
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,750
I have a mini-concert in a Saitama shopping mall.

1756
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:32,420
Don't see you on morning shift often, Sakuta.

1757
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,500
And you? What about practice?

1758
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,960
It's in the afternoon today.

1759
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,800
Arriving fashionably late, Koga?

1760
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,880
This is just when my shift starts!

1761
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,800
Wh-What?

1762
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,470
I don't know...

1763
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,720
Have you ballooned a little?

1764
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,600
Did you eat a lot of mochi over New Year's?

1765
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:49,730
You're the worst!

1766
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,440
Now I'm steamin'!

1767
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:54,190
Welcome!

1768
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,320
I'll have the hearty carbonara—

1769
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,240
Sorry.

1770
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,320
Make that one of these.

1771
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,700
You don't need to diet.
You haven't really ballooned—

1772
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,410
Ah, I see.

1773
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:13,620
I'm telling Sakurajima-senpai that you're leering at me.

1774
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:18,750
We're going on a shrine visit date later,
so please reconsider. She'll yell at me.

1775
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,260
So in other words,
you do want me to tell her?

1776
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,090
I guess.

1777
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:25,680
You really are a total pig.

1778
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,810
New Year

1779
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,270
What's wrong?

1780
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,070
Lend me some money for an offering.

1781
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:41,490
I donated to charity on the way,
so I'm out of change.

1782
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,740
Then use a note.

1783
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,460
Were you able to make a wish
worth the thousand yen?

1784
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:57,960
I wished that I wouldn't run into
so many weird situations this year.

1785
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,050
Weird situations, huh?

1786
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:03,260
But hey, that's how you met me.

1787
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:06,840
One wild bunny girl is enough for me.

1788
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:14,520
You really do like going to the beach, huh?

1789
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,230
Not as much as I like you.

1790
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:20,650
You must adore the high-school girl
you saw in your dreams.

1791
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:24,030
This is where you two often met, right?

1792
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:26,320
Yeah, but only in my dreams.

1793
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,330
But hey, you love this beach too.

1794
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,410
I have fond memories of my shoots here.

1795
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:39,460
A girl with a heart disease
waiting for a donor...

1796
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:37,540
The

1797
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:37,540

01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,730
anata to nokosu koukai

3053
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,730
I leave regrets with you by my side

3054
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:27,730
dare mo yomenai karte

3055
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:27,730
Nobody can read my medical chart

3056
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:32,410
fuyukai kurikaeshite

3057
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:32,410
So vexing, rinse and repeat

3058
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:48,350
tadashii yume wa

3059
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:48,350
Are pure dreams

3060
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:53,350
kanashii koe wa

3061
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:53,350
Are sad screams

3062
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:55,860
Utsukushii?

3063
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:55,860
Sexy?

3064
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,340
utagawashii?

3065
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,340
Shady?

3066
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,550
urayamashii?

3067
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,550
Salty?

3068
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:05,200
nee dore?

3069
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:05,200
Which is it?

3070
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,210
katarenai nemurenai traumerei

3071
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,210
I can't talk about it or sleep, so I daydream

3072
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:15,210
anata no miteru shoutai

3073
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:15,210
These are my true colors, as you see

3074
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:20,210
dare mo yomenai karte

3075
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:20,210
Nobody can read my medical chart

3076
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:25,170
fukashigi shiritai dake

3077
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:25,170
So puzzling, I just want to know what it means

3078
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:30,180
owaranai koto wa nai traumerei

3079
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:30,180
One day my daydream will end

3080
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:35,240
anata to matagu kyoukai

3081
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:35,240
As I cross the border with you at my side

3082
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:40,160
dare mo yomenai karte

3083
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:40,160
Nobody can read my medical chart

3084
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:45,240
shishunki kizuguchi mune no uchi

3085
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:45,240
Puberty, these wounds, what's on your mind

3086
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:50,120
fukashigi shiritai dake

3087
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:50,120
So puzzling, I just want to know what they mean

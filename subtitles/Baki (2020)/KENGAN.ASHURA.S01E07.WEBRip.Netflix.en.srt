1
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,389
Hisayasu Takemoto, 82 years old.

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,476
HISAYASU TAKEMOTO
FIGHTER, THE BYAKUYA SHIMBUN COMPANY

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,854
At the age of 45, he founded
the "Takemoto Style Combat Kenpo."

4
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,106
In the 37 years since,

5
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,235
he has fought more
than 90 unofficial matches,

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,111
and has never lost a single one.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,407
Before long, people started
to call him "God of War."

8
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,163
Unbelievable!
It's impossible that Takemoto could lose!

9
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,332
TESAKI AKANO
PRESIDENT, THE BYAKUYA SHIMBUN COMPANY

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,750
Sorry he didn't win.

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,128
Who the hell are you?

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,220
I'm so happy!

13
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,472
MACHIZO INUI
FIGHTER, UMIICHI SECURITIES

14
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,432
Now I can break humans as much as I like.

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,606
Kengan matches are... awesome!

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,150
Your fighter is unable to fight anymore.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,778
Instead of this useless piece of crap,

18
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,115
hire me as your fighter.

19
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,409
But keep this in mind.

20
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:20,581
If I become the champion, you must
appoint a specific person as chairman.

21
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,623
Oh my...

22
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,835
Mr. Nogi's words have come true.

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,171
Considering the high-handed manner,
that man could well be behind it.

24
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,632
RINO KURAYOSHI
REPRESENTATIVE, GOLD PLEASURE GROUP

25
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,593
REI MIKAZUCHI
FIGHTER, GOLD PLEASURE GROUP

26
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,803
Give me five seconds.
Wait here, Rino.

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,640
All I want is your fighter spot.

28
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,186
You don't want to get hurt
by pointlessly resisting, do you?

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,359
In this world, there are some people
who are believed to be geniuses.

30
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,405
Cosmo Imai, 19 years old.

31
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,493
At the age of 14, he became
the youngest ever debut in a kengan match.

32
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:04,583
Against a man 20cm taller
and 30kg heavier than himself,

33
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,004
he won by ippon,
making his debut a sensation.

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,300
His record in kengan matches is...

35
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,178
twenty-one wins and no losses.

36
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,475
There's no doubt about his talent.

37
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,649
Cosmo Imai is a true genius.

38
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,320
Python Hold.

39
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,197
You'll be finished soon.

40
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,491
Sweet dreams.

41
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,247
I think you've really underestimated
the kengan match.

42
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,249
COSMO IMAI
A.K.A. "THE KING OF STRANGLERS"

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,502
What's going on?

44
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,427
Oh, no! You've gone too far, Wakatsuki.

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,763
Too fragile.
He was broken by one attack.

46
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,016
TAKESHI WAKATSUKI, LONGEST-SERVING FIGHTER
306 WINS 2 LOSSES, HIGHEST WIN RECORD

47
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,986
THE NIGHT BEFORE

48
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,072
Sorry, Rino.

49
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,201
I kept you waiting for 22 seconds.

50
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,872
Raise your head, Rei. I don't mind.

51
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,125
Now you understand, don't you?

52
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,755
Cheap tricks won't work on us.

53
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,009
That woman is aware of the camera.

54
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,764
Rino Kurayoshi... she's a really
tough one to deal with, as usual.

55
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,018
-Shall I get rid of her?
-You don't have to. Leave her alone.

56
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,313
We've gained two more spots, after all.

57
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,567
Now our company has six spots,
including yours.

58
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,195
We are fully prepared.

59
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,782
The time has come.

60
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,368
KATSUMASA HAYAMI
CHAIRMAN, TOYO ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY

61
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,455
Get ready, Metsudo Katahara.
Your reign is going to end soon.

62
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,040
KAEDE AKIYAMA
NOGI GROUP

63
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,041
I can't believe it.

64
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,627
Lihito, how could you lose
all your money at the casino?

65
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,337
OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,130
LIHITO
PRESIDENT &amp; FIGHTER, SH FROZEN STORAGE

67
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:41,716
What would you have done
if I hadn't paid it off for you?

68
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,426
I apologize.

69
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,886
Why am I here?

70
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,472
-And you, Ohma.
-What?

71
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,894
I saw you encouraging all those ladies to
sit with you at the casino. Shame on you!

72
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,898
That wasn't my fault.
They wouldn't leave me alone.

73
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,277
My point is, you two are at risk
of getting attacked at any moment.

74
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,488
-Please refrain from acting so carelessly.
-Okay, okay.

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,532
Well, well. I think that's enough.

76
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,118
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

77
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,169
What the...?

78
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,756
I see. You're the assassin, aren't you?

79
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,050
Dodged!

80
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,468
You asshole!

81
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,142
So, your target must be Tokita!

82
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,982
He used Tokita's leg to jump up on him?

83
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,110
This jerk is...

84
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,450
You have some nerve.

85
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,368
It's Ohma's turn to attack.

86
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,709
Ground grappling techniques?

87
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,504
It's not a bad idea.

88
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:06,217
But unfortunately, you're too light.

89
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,305
He stopped at the last moment!

90
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,351
I'd have landed that blow
if I hadn't noticed. You brat.

91
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,564
A girl?

92
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,902
You can't mask your gender.
I could tell by your scent.

93
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,197
What the hell do you want?

94
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,287
I want to have a baby with you.

95
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,705
What?

96
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,960
I knew you were strong
as soon as I saw you.

97
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,214
I'm Karura. Be my husband.

98
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,216
That's, um...

99
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,469
-A marriage proposal?
-Why is she asking him now?

100
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,304
My grandpa told me

101
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,641
that it's the responsibility of the head
of the family to have strong offspring.

102
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,437
-Excuse me, miss. Could you explain--
-Let's make babies together!

103
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,689
Hello, are you ignoring me?

104
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,733
They were all very confused

105
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,486
by her sudden and baffling
marriage proposal.

106
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,949
But the one who felt most confused was...

107
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,867
this man.

108
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,161
Babies? Husband?

109
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,956
Me? With this girl?

110
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,667
What the hell is she talking about?

111
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,462
Wow, even Ohma is shocked,
and he's usually so cool!

112
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,758
Come on, let's make some babies together!
Children that are yours and mine!

113
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,511
Our children will undoubtedly
become the greatest ever warriors!

114
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,847
Let's get married right now!

115
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,817
Wait, Ohma! Where are you going?

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,404
I think he's running away because
the situation got too much for him.

117
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,780
He's acting like a kid.

118
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,949
There you are, Karura.

119
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,869
Don't wander around on your own.

120
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,121
Those guys are from...

121
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,205
the Kure Family.

122
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,999
REICHI KURE &amp; HOLLIS KURE
KURE FAMILY

123
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,626
-What would you do if you got lost?
-Let's get back.

124
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,212
Grandpa is worried about you.

125
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,174
I don't like the nasty way
they're looking at us.

126
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,092
It's like we're their prey.

127
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,429
We're very sorry one
of our family bothered you.

128
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,890
No problem at all.

129
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,975
-His name...
-What?

130
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,560
KARURA KURE
KURE FAMILY

131
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,062
What's his name?

132
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,522
The name of your future husband?

133
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,608
It's Seaweed Head Monster.

134
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,735
His name is Ohma Tokita.

135
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,404
Ohma Tokita.

136
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,865
It's not sea eel, okay?

137
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,617
He's Ohma.

138
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,705
Tell Ohma
that I want to see him again.

139
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,958
I guess he won't want to though.

140
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,253
Welcome back, Karura.

141
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,297
HORIO KURE, ERIO KURE, RAIAN KURE
KURE FAMILY

142
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,633
-Did you enjoy your expedition?
-Grandpa.

143
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,010
I have...

144
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,013
I have a crush on someone.

145
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,976
What? That's...

146
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,772
-That's nice, honey.
-Yeah.

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,984
We'll talk more about it later.

148
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,613
-Go and have dinner now.
-Okay!

149
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,617
The kid's taken an interest in boys!

150
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,203
Stop teasing, Raian.

151
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,123
What's going on?

152
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,044
His name is Ohma Tokita,
he represents Yamashita Corporation.

153
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,465
Oh... he was the one
I saw with Lihito at the match.

154
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,470
I see, so it's him.

155
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,182
That son of a bitch!

156
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,354
Karura's still in high school.
How could he hit on her?

157
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,440
That goddamn moron!

158
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,484
My sides hurt.

159
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,945
You know what to do, right?

160
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,197
Keep an eye on Ohma Tokita.

161
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,492
If he comes near Karura again,

162
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,787
erase him completely from this world!

163
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,999
Don't leave so much as
one of his hairs behind!

164
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,043
Hey, old man.

165
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,047
You're losing control of yourself.

166
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,886
Inside the Kure, a demon resides.

167
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,225
Daybreak has arrived.

168
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,396
We will soon arrive at the site
where the decisive battle will take place.

169
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,774
I believe you've already chosen...

170
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,111
METSUDO KATAHARA, GOVERNOR OF DAINIPPON
BANK &amp; KENGAN ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN

171
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,488
...the fighter in whom
you will entrust your destiny.

172
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:45,872
The bloody battle between men of valour
is finally about to begin.

173
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,124
I welcome this grim setting.

174
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,334
GANRYU ISLAND

175
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,128
It is the perfect place
to fight to the death!

176
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,590
Okay, I must prepare myself.

177
00:11:55,798 --> 00:12:00,845
Whatever happens from now on,
I will not lose my cool!

178
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,696
GANRYU ISLAND HOTEL

179
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,200
VENUE OF THE DRAWING
OF PAIRINGS FOR THE TOURNAMENT

180
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,662
FOR THE PARTICIPANTS OF
THE LIFE-OR-DEATH TOURNAMENT

181
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,290

TOMARI TOHGO

183
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,292
Y. DAZAI
MUJI TV NETWORK

184
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,295
Do you know who he is?

185
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,867
TAKASHI HASHIDA, SENTORY CHAIRMAN
KOHNO AKIO, NENTENDO PRESIDENT

186
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:38,748
He's the new face
they've been talking about.

187
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,553
I feel completely out of place.

188
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,222
JUZO MAGATANI
PRESIDENT, MAGATANIEN

189
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,724
Why are we still waiting?
Come on, shake a leg!

190
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,856
KATSUMASA HAYAMI
CHAIRMAN, TOYO ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY

191
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,610
Am I really meant to compete
with these eminent people?

192
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,405
Is that Ken?

193
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,739
KEN OHYA
GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

194
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,699
Hi, Ken.

195
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,289
Why is Ken with Mr. Hayami?

196
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,668
I'm expecting a favorable response
from you, Mr. Ohya.

197
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,505
It would be better for you
not to choose the wrong side.

198
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,091
Thank you very much
for your kind advice.

199
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,970
What's wrong with Ken?

200
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,557
Oh dear, you're Mr. Yamashita,
the man everyone's talking about.

201
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,976
Oh, President Yoshitake.

202
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,186
YOSHIRO YOSHITAKE
PRESIDENT, YOSHITAKE REAL ESTATE

203
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,315
It's been a while. I didn't think it was
possible to come here by total fluke.

204
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,441
And Lihito.

205
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,946
You're the president and the fighter?
Don't make me laugh.

206
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:48,202
I've found the strongest fighter
of you all, you'll be no match for him!

207
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,207
You know what?
You've got the wrong idea.

208
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,044
It's been a long time
since I worked for you.

209
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,172
You're not my employer anymore,
you're not anything to me.

210
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,798
We are complete strangers to each other.

211
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:06,471
Stop acting like the top man
or I'll rip your body apart, my ex-boss.

212
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,683
You're just showing off!

213
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,728
-He ran away.
-Oh my...

214
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,064
It's nice you're all good friends.

215
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,107
RINO KURAYOSHI
REPRESENTATIVE. GOLD PLEASURE GROUP

216
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,275
Wow, Rino!

217
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,611
What an outrageously
beautiful lady she is.

218
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,279
Attention, please.

219
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,990
Thank you for waiting.

220
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,743
Metsudo Katahara is here.

221
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,747
Hmm... Is that Chairman Nogi?

222
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,832
HIDEKI NOGI
CHAIRMAN, NOGI GROUP

223
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,043
He looks fired up.

224
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,421
I've never seen Mr. Nogi
with such a serious look on his face.

225
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,177
No wonder.
His company will be finished if he loses.

226
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,261
What?

227
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,349
Excuse me, Rino.
What do you mean by "finished"?

228
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:56,521
Well, if the promoter, Mr. Nogi,
loses in this tournament,

229
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,857
Nogi Group will be dissolved immediately.

230
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,567
-Dissolved?
-Dissolved?

231
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,988
Bankruptcy, in other words?
This is terrible!

232
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,158
I don't want to lose my job at my age.

233
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:16,541
But wait. Remember the debt
I was forced to bear? Five billion yen.

234
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,960
I might be able to cancel
the contract, right?

235
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:23,297
Yes, the slate will be wiped clean
if the company goes belly up.

236
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,761
As I also have some savings,
I think I'll be able to figure a way out.

237
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,805
I heard from Mr. Nogi...

238
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,809
that you two bet your lives
on the tournament.

239
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,686
What? Our lives?

240
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,773
He said that you managed to make
the five billion yen entry fee

241
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,985
by taking out a mortgage
on all of your private assets.

242
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:44,944
What?

243
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:50,825
You'll be literally penniless if you lose.
You have such indomitable spirit.

244
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,037
What? Didn't he just lend the money to me?

245
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:01,210
If we lose the tournament does this
mean my life is going to fall apart?

246
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,381
We are in the same boat, Yamashita.

247
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,260
Jeez... I think I have no hope left.

248
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,513
You must all be ready by now.

249
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:19,145
We are now going to determine
the tournament match-ups.

250
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,272
KENGAN ASSOCIATION

251
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,356
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

252
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,860
-We must win at any cost, Kazuo.
-Oh my...

253
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,832
DAINIPPON BANK

254
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,113
Dainippon Bank has already been placed

255
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,949
in the last game of the first round.

256
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,953
I'm sure all of you
will already be aware of this.

257
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
The game you should
pay attention to is this one.

258
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:44,545
The battle with the strongest fighter,
Agito Kanoh, or Fang of Metsudo,

259
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,923
is the one you must try to avoid.

260
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,299
True.

261
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:53,012
We don't want our fighters to have to
fight a fully fit Fang in the first round.

262
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,350
Now, let's get started.

263
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,394
We're going to use this.

264
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,813
-What is it?
-What's that?

265
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,399
SUKIZO URITA
PRESIDENT, PENASONIC CORP

266
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,567
What is that machine, sir?

267
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,279
I'll demonstrate how it works
so it's easier for you to understand.

268
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,199
Here, here, here...

269
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,534
And here.

270
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,911
That's it.

271
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:23,668
The higher your number, the sooner you
can choose your position in the match-up.

272
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,002
MAKOTO YANAGI
UNITED CLOTHING

273
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,420
SHUNKA HIYAMA
WAKASA LIFE INSURANCE

274
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,549
I'm not using any machine you've
brought in. You could cheat us!

275
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,885
I've very kindly made
these arrangements for you.

276
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,972
Stop complaining and obey my rule!

277
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,476
Well, who wants to go first?

278
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,602
I do!

279
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,563
-Well...
-I'll go first!

280
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,773
What about the new face, Mr. Yamashita?

281
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,946
No!

282
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,409
Okay! Come on, Yamashita.

283
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,453
What did I do to deserve this?

284
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,622
Now! Push the button.

285
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,337
Too fast. I have no choice.

286
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,048
I'll just push the button at random.

287
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,802
Wait. What's this?

288
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,555
Is it... okay?

289
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,519
You did it, Yamashita.

290
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:29,233
You got 989,086,296.

291
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,029
-Wow.
-We've started with a huge number.

292
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:37,408
You're very likely to go
first in the match-ups.

293
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,660
Huh? Ah, y... yes.

294
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:45,541
No one noticed that the speed
slowed down strangely.

295
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,169
Was it cheating?

296
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:52,298
Well, I guess it's okay.
I'll keep quiet unless someone notices.

297
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,635
Good! I'll follow Kazuo's lead!

298
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,515
-Only three digits.
-He should have paid closer attention.

299
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,729
I can't get the exact number I want.

300
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,192
But all I have to do is to focus on
the far-left digit.

301
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,112
Another big number!

302
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,200
AKIRA NISHIHONJI

303
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,203
SHION SORYUIN

304
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,414
All right, now we know everyone's score.

305
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,168
Let's start with Yamashita Corporation
as they got the top score.

306
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,586
Yes!

307
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,631
Which one will you choose?

308
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,258
Well, um...

309
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:40,388
The main thing to avoid
is being in the same block as Fang.

310
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,597
Excuse me, sir.

311
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,599
Have you decided yet?

312
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,978
Yes... well, then...
I'd like to choose that position.

313
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,357
Number eight in the fourth game.

314
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,566
YAMASHITA CORPORATION

315
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,655
It's obvious that he'd choose the opposite
block to the one with Fang of Metsudo.

316
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,991
He'll also be able to get a feel for
the tournament from the first three games.

317
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,993
MASAHIKO OHTA
PRESIDENT, UNDER MOUNT INC

318
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,496
The earlier game will help
his fighter maintain his motivation

319
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,082
What an excellent choice.

320
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,461
I was rushed into choosing it at random.

321
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,090
I hope Ohma will be all right with this.

322
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,550
All right.

323
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,594
We have completed
the tournament match-ups.

324
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,555
You are dismissed!

325
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,267
Was it really a good choice?

326
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,436
Finally, it's time
to kick off the festival!

327
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,187
JUN SEKIBAYASHI
FIGHTER, GANDAI

328
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,939
Alrighty! I've waited so long for this!

329
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,816
SAW PAING YOROIZUKA
FIGHTER, VILLAGE OF DAWN

330
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,193
I've been feeling the urge to fight.

331
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,612
I note you're as noisy as always.

332
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,698
GAOLAN WONGSAWAT
FIGHTER, YAZU TRADING

333
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,659
Why is a guy like you interested in
this tournament anyway, Saw Paing?

334
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,079
You're asking me why?
What a silly question!

335
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,956
It's obvious, Gaolan.

336
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,418
A man should talk with his fist, right?

337
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,212
-Yes!
-So annoying.

338
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,465
In this tournament,
no one can be underestimated.

339
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,508
KEIZABURO SAWADA
FIGHTER, MURDER MUSIC

340
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,769
But I'm pretty sure that
I'm going to end up champion.

341
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,805
What are you doing? So creepy!

342
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,766
RYO INABA
FIGHTER, PENASONIC CORPORATION

343
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,144
Well, well... it's going
to get really tough now.

344
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,979
SEN HATSUMI
FIGHTER, NOGI GROUP

345
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,023
Actually, I'm not
the kind of guy to work hard.

346
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,236
I'm finally going to fight with you,
Ohma Tokita.

347
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,197
SETSUNA KIRYU
FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

348
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,782
I won't let anyone get in my way.

349
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,367
I'll annihilate them.
I'm going to kill them all.

350
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,787
RAIAN KURE
FIGHTER, UNDER MOUNT INC

351
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,165
This is the secret side
of the Japanese economy.

352
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,543
It's a world of demonic war,
full of ambition and conspiracy,

353
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,047
where people struggle for power.

354
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,133
This is a proxy war...

355
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,220
using an extremely simple tool: violence.

356
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,892
Now, 32 companies and their fighters
are aiming for the top position.

357
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,270
Who is the strongest?

358
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,065
AGITO KANOH, A.K.A. "FANG OF METSUDO"
THE EMPEROR OF KENGAN MATCHES

359
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:02,446
I wonder if I made a right choice.

360
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:07,076
I don't think they'll give me
another chance, though...

361
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:19,663
We'll do it, Kazuo Yamashita.

362
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:22,174
OHMA TOKITA, FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORP.
NIKO TOKITA'S SUCCESSOR

363
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,093
Yes...

364
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,388
We will!

365
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,977
Finally, the Kengan Life-or-Death
Tournament is about to start.

366
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,980
THE KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH
TOURNAMENT BEGINS

367
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:06,904
PREVIEW

368
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,947
The wait is over.

369
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,367
The Kengan Life-or-Death
Tournament has begun.

370
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,994
It's fists versus
ground grappling techniques.

371
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:17,706
I am, I am, I am...
stronger than you!

372
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,249
Next episode: "The Battle Begins"

373

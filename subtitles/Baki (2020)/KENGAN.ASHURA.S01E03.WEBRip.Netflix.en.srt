1
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,388
The Kengan match

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:19,603
can only be watched by selected members
and other authorized people.

3
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,940
It is held outside of the public eye.

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,861
The particular atmosphere
makes them so enthusiastic

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,740
that a huge amount of money is exchanged
in just a moment.

6
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,580
The next Kengan match will be
between GANDAI and Nogi Group.

7
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,208
VENUE: UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT
KIMURA SECURITIES BUILDING

8
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:47,339
Ohma Tokita,
the affiliated fighter for Nogi Group.

9
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,425
Chairman Nogi
and Ms. Akiyama are late.

10
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,302
The match could begin at any moment.

11
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,638
KAZUO YAMASHITA
NOGI PUBLICATIONS, NOGI GROUP

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,974
Well, I still can't believe it.

13
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,435
Ohma's opponent for today is--

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,064
On the other side is
the affiliated fighter for GANDAI.

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,859
Jun Sekibayashi!

16
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,906
Jun Sekibayashi, known as "Hell's Angel,"
from Super Japan Pro-Wrestling,

17
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,869
a major organization covering
every style from hardcore to standard.

18
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,581
As its unshakable champion,

19
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,710
he is a big name
in public combat sports.

20
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,921
Public combat sports versus
underground martial arts...

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:32,259
I can't miss such a big match!

22
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:07,979
THE STRONG

23
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,608
Stay away from each other.
On your mark, okay?

24
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,819
Hey, new boy.

25
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,946
I'll tell you something.

26
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,992
I'm nothing like the guys you've fought
so far in your Kengan career.

27
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,788
I am the first fighter you've faced

28
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,040
who is an authentic warrior.

29
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,044
Are you ready, you two?

30
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,672
Okay, set.

31
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,091
-Fight!
-Now let's--

32
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,222
You are such a talkative warrior.

33
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,266
You're totally unguarded.

34
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,188
Sorry for that.

35
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,025
The nature of my profession
makes me talkative.

36
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,658
Nice reflexes.

37
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,620
Arm Whip?
A classic technique.

38
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,209
Ohma's punch didn't hurt him.

39
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,628
He's physically tougher than Lihito.

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,964
Yes, you're doing well.

41
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,267
Although it was such
a strange form of kicking,

42
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,562
he easily kicked out Ohma
who weighs over 80kg!

43
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,650
This is a professional wrestler.
This is Jun Sekibayashi!

44
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,114
HIDEKI NOGI,
CHAIRMAN OF NOGI GROUP

45
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,118
GEN SHIKANO,
CHAIRMAN OF GANDAI

46
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,369
You're doing well.

47
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,663
Exercise your right fully.

48
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,373
Right to what?

49
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,295
I mean, you guys have a right...

50
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,799
to escape from pain.

51
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,135
By receiving, passing off,
or avoiding the attacks,

52
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,806
you can use all possible ways
to guard yourself.

53
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,643
On the other hand,
we wrestlers have a duty.

54
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,064
Whether it's blunt weapons, knives
or even bombs,

55
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,692
professional wrestlers have a duty
to face them head-on.

56
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,239
This is your right, and our duty.

57
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,535
Now exercise your right
as much as you like.

58
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,078
You amateur.

59
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,166
He looks down on
all people except pro-wrestlers.

60
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,961
He's clearly looking down!

61
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,675
Do you like close combat?

62
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,930
You rat! What are you doing?

63
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,307
You've just escaped...

64
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,059
from pain.

65
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,645
You failed to fulfill your duty.

66
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,023
You think you're funny?

67
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,738
Here it comes! Ohma's...

68
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,031
Ohma's what?

69
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,493
A technique... to control
the flow of power!

70
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,792
It's working! Go Ohma!

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,211
Keep on pushing.

72
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,090
Give him a finishing one, Ohma!

73
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,639
Okay, the bonus time is over.

74
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,017
Just remember.

75
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:37,063
We professional wrestlers are
great actors, too.

76
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,481
No, Ohma!

77
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,781
That's the first time
I've heard that sound.

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,911
The sound of flesh
being slammed down on the concrete floor.

79
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,955
Tokita, you okay?

80
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,041
-Can you go on?
-Stand up!

81
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,672
-All right, then! Here I go!
-Sekibayashi!

82
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,595
He pulled him up!

83
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,187
Once again.

84
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,318
Ohma, please!

85
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,947
Has he... blacked out?

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,990
All right, another one!

87
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,367
Sekibayashi!

88
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,499
-Ohma!
-Great, Sekibayashi!

89
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,167
Finish him off!

90
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,587
You should surrender now, young man!

91
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:47,133
You can't win,
so just give up before he kills you.

92
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,845
-Take it back!
-Huh?

93
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,140
Take back what you just said.

94
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,476
Who are you?

95
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,312
Ohma never loses.

96
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,608
He will never lose,
even if the opponent is Sekibayashi.

97
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,112
"Never loses"?

98
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,699
But how could he win in that situation?

99
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,952
Sorry to tell you this,
but there's no chance.

100
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,870
You don't understand.

101
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:21,209
Ohma Tokita is a man
who'll never end like this.

102
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,046
Whatever kind of monster it is,
he can ultimately beat it.

103
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,881
That's Ohma!

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,596
Sorry to interrupt your speech,
but your friend is about to be ended.

105
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,767
All right. It's almost the time
to finish this match.

106
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,688
Dramatically, okay?

107
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,232
-Yay!
-Oh no!

108
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,402
That's Sekibayashi's killer technique.

109
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,320
Argentine Backbreaker!

110
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,700
No way!

111
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,243
Please.

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,246
Will you really end here, Ohma?

113
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,581
Come on!

114
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,043
For God's sake, please fight back!

115
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,314
When was the last time I came here?

116
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,949
I'll borrow it from you again
for the first time in a while.

117
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,000
What's that sound?

118
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,504
What the heck is going on?

119
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,473
What... did you do to me?

120
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,642
His... fingers!

121
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,480
What did I do?

122
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,612
I’ve borrowed something in advance!

123
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,031
Huh? What are you talking about?

124
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,325
Solid...

125
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,999
Wow, he's pushing.

126
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,462
He's pushing a man who weighs
60kg more than himself with his power.

127
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,297
What strength that guy has!

128
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,007
No.

129
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,093
That's not him.

130
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,387
That's not his usual style.

131
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,098
What on earth happened to him?

132
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,226
You jerk.

133
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,230
It's getting much more fun!

134
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,956
Ha! I'm quite disadvantaged...

135
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,958
with these fingers.

136
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,420
But... excellent!

137
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,464
The harder my challenge is...

138
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,096
the more excited the audience gets.

139
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,893
He did a backhand chop
with broken fingers!

140
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,397
That didn't stop him, huh?

141
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,236
What's going on in this match?

142
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,282
Tokita punches brutally
and Sekibayashi just withstands it.

143
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,284
Is it an endurance game?

144
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,580
Hey, look.

145
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,418
He's even going forward.

146
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,837
Being attacked like a typhoon...

147
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,506
Sekibayashi isn't over yet!

148
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,259
He kicked him back.

149
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,053
Neither gives in an inch.

150
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,102
No.

151
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,815
It's entirely different from
Ohma's usual fighting style.

152
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,820
TAKESHI WAKATSUKI,
FURUMI PHARMA

153
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,948
What's up, Wakatsuki?

154
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,784
Hey, Imai.

155
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,744
Hey. Long time no see.

156
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,704
COSMO IMAI,
NISHIHONJI SECURITY SERVICES

157
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,207
Well, he's amazing.

158
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,877
His power is no less than
that of Sekibayashi.

159
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,131
That's not about power but rotation rate.

160
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,549
Rotation rate?

161
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,345
Right. What increased in him is
not the power but the speed.

162
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:47,881
With the same mass, his attack naturally
gets stronger according to the speed.

163
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:50,311
The faster speed also
tremendously increases

164
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,940
the frequency of punches
compared to before.

165
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,276
That is the rotation rate.

166
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,364
You guys always think about
such complicated stuff while you fight?

167
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,700
You think too little.

168
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,539
What I want to know is
where this new power came from.

169
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,667
Anyway, the way Tokita moves is different

170
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,545
from that in the match with Lihito.

171
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,553
Today's Ohma looks like a savage beast

172
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,306
that shows raw aggressiveness
and demonic character.

173
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,808
I've never seen this side of him.

174
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,186
Is it Ohma's true identity?

175
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,027
-It's a hit!
-What are you doing, Sekibayashi?

176
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,613
-Defend yourself!
-I bet a lot of money on you!

177
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,034
They don't understand.

178
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,705
How could you be a professional wrestler

179
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,624
without taking all the attacks?

180
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,214
Come on!

181
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,558
-Sekibayashi is coming back!
-Go!

182
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,602
Hey, what's wrong?

183
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,855
Don't take a rest there.

184
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,527
Okay, I'm going to finish this match.

185
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,987
Sekibayashi!

186
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,657
-Finish it!
-Ohma, please!

187
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,746
Here I come!

188
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,479
What was that?

189
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,399
-That was...
-Yeah.

190
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,652
That man cut off his air supply.

191
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,695
Finished?

192
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,364
What just happened?

193
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,867
He beat Sekibayashi with one punch?

194
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,214
I see!

195
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,217
He targeted Sekibayashi's windpipe.

196
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,679
Once the air supply to the brain
is cut off,

197
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,056
his tenacity doesn't matter anymore.

198
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,101
He couldn't stay conscious.

199
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,148
Ohma's attacking power, combined with
Sekibayashi's rushing power,

200
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,358
converted entirely into
damage to Sekibayashi.

201
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,946
Ohma was waiting for a chance to counter.

202
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,187
The winner is Ohma Tokita for Nogi Group.

203
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:52,118
WINNER: OHMA TOKITA (NOGI GROUP)
LOSER: JUN SEKIBAYASHI (GANDAI)

204
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,329
Yes.

205
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,040
He did it!

206
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,835
I was wrong.

207
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,171
He's not different at all.

208
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,800
As I saw, the primal instinct of fighting
and the sophisticated game plan

209
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,554
are the true nature of Ohma Tokita.

210
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,556
You were too hardy.

211
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,600
Old man.

212
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,439
Oh gosh, you won. You have an eye.

213
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,233
Oh, thank you.

214
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,569
I like you!

215
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,406
-Let's have a drink someday.
-Ah, yes.

216
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,618
A drink?

217
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,080
Oh, well. Whatever.
I have to take care of Ohma first.

218
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,208
Excellent!

219
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,046
What a surprise!

220
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,884
-Is that the chairman?
-No way.

221
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,349
It was excellent.

222
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,186
Who's that?

223
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,814
-That's...
-Chairman Katahara!

224
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,900
Katahara?

225
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,370
I must be dreaming.
Why?

226
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,757
What is the governor of
Dainippon Bank doing here?!

227
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,950
METSUDO KATAHARA

228
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,535
Why is he...

229
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,994
Just to watch the match?

230
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,789
As he's here, Fang must be here, too...

231
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,750
What do you think, Wakatsuki?

232
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,710
I'm not sure, but...

233
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,880
The chairman of the Kengan Association
has come.

234
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,800
It's obvious the situation is
out of the ordinary.

235
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,927
Chairman Katahara.

236
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,846
Hi, Nogi.

237
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,309
I really appreciate
your coming here today.

238
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,394
Nogi.

239
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,564
You found a great fighter.

240
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,899
You agree with me, right?

241
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,945
Don't you, Sekibayashi?

242
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,447
He's indeed a great fighter.

243
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,451
I had no idea I would lose.

244
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,330
Shit... it’s surprising that hardly
any damage is left in him.

245
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,458
For now, you're the winner.

246
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,630
Even Sekibayashi approves his ability.

247
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,174
It means he really is someone.

248
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,719
So, did you make a decision?

249
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,554
Shikano.

250
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,347
Yes, sir.

251
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,808
You won, Mr. Nogi.

252
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,393
I keep my word.

253
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,480
We, GANDAI, agree with the resolution
proposed by Nogi Group,

254
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:31,402
calling for the battle for the chairman's
post of the Kengan Association.

255
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,409
The battle for the chairman's post!

256
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:45,499
You need 50 affirmative votes to hold
the battle for the chairman's post.

257
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,628
Now the conditions are satisfied.

258
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,671
Which means...

259
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:57,261
You qualify for crossing swords with me,
Metsudo Katahara.

260
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,264
So much pressure.

261
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,645
An enormous energy like from a volcano
is blowing out from that thin old man.

262
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,230
With his overwhelming presence,

263
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,983
he is like a supernatural being
in a human shape.

264
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,902
I can't move an inch.

265
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,989
His outrageously extravagant pressure
is still present.

266
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,577
Or, I should say, it keeps growing,
even if he is over 90 already.

267
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,621
That spooky old man...

268
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,956
I know what I'm doing.

269
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:30,878
Metsudo Katahara, the 58th chairman
of the Kengan Association.

270
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,214
I will make you leave your position.

271
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,802
That's a good one.

272
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,555
You really make me excited.

273
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,808
I accept your challenge.

274
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,728
I allow you to use anything you have

275
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,232
to beat me and Fang of Metsudo.

276
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,484
Fang of Metsudo...

277
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,820
And Fang of Metsudo himself is...

278
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,948
not with us now, unfortunately.

279
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,116
Fang...

280
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,535
It's quite difficult to beat him.

281
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,662
What the...

282
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,415
The air is thick with tension.

283
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,751
Excuse me, what is Fang of Metsudo?

284
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,713
-Don't you know?
-No.

285
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,966
He's the fighter
that Metsudo Katahara has.

286
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,595
They say he's the strongest fighter
of all Kengan history.

287
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,473
The strongest!

288
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:30,896
His record is 157 victories and no losses,
something no one has ever accomplished.

289
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,735
Fang...

290
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,740
Mr. Katahara, please.

291
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,201
Well... as of today,

292
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,330
as the chairman
of the Kengan Association,

293
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,001
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

294
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:57,590
I hereby declare the opening
of the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament.

295
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,095
"Death" means you may die, right?

296
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,098
Sounds interesting, I want to join it!

297
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,851
Maybe I should lead my boss on.

298
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,688
Of course, we will participate
in the tournament, too.

299
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,940
I'll count on you, Sekibayashi.

300
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,152
Really? You've just seen me lose, sir.

301
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,823
Unfortunately, I don't know
any other fighter greater than you.

302
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,952
Besides, professional wrestling is
the best of three points, isn't it?

303
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,998
The best of three points?
What classic rule are you talking about?

304
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,669
I feel raging energy from each of you.

305
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,882
Your wish has no value when it's easily
granted just by having it in mind.

306
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,386
Something you truly need is
always lying beyond death.

307
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,516
Anyone who wishes to take the position
of the Association Chairman is welcome.

308
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:53,062
Send the fighter you think
is the strongest to the tournament!

309
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,065
It doesn't matter
if he is a martial artist,

310
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,109
a gangster, or even a psycho killer.

311
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,612
Defeat my Fang

312
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:06,742
and grab your real life beyond death.

313
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,869
A tournament?

314
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,039
That'll work for me.

315
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,336
That bastard never misses
an exciting event like this.

316
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,340
I'm sure he'll show up.

317
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,592
Definitely.

318
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,015
I've been waiting for you, asshole.

319
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,226
Get ready for my attack...

320
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,062
preserved for these ten years.

321
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,489
A story of a grudge.

322
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,240
A wish for revenge.

323
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,868
Too far to regard him as a longtime enemy.

324
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,330
Beyond the food chain in the jungle law,

325
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,123
there is a man waiting for him.

326
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,075

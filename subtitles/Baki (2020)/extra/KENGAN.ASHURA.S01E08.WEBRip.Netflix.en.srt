1
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,022
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

2
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,778
FIST

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,544
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

4
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,447
Wow. This place is packed.

5
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,081
World leaders are here?

6
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,166
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORP

7
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:58,243
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

8
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,457
A woman?

9
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,168
Her name is Sayaka Katahara.
She's the chairman's daughter.

10
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,211
KAEDE AKIYAMA
CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY, NOGI GROUP

11
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,212
Is she?

12
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,174
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

13
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,967
SAYAKA KATAHARA
DAUGHTER OF METSUDO KATAHARA

14
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:20,140
And now, the Kengan Life-or-Death
Tournament will begin!

15
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,656
Kengan matches produce
such a special kind of enthusiasm.

16
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,451
They're nothing like
other public martial arts matches.

17
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,707
METSUDO KATAHARA,
KENGAN ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN

18
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,292
It's heating up already!

19
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,213
I have great hopes for this tournament.

20
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:26,933
THE BATTLE BEGINS

21
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,612
COSMO IMAI
FIGHTER, NISHIHONJI SECURITY SERVICES

22
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,491
When I was younger and
a little more of a rascal,

23
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,703
I was getting myself into fights
day in, day out.

24
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,873
Bring it on, assholes!

25
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,086
On that day,
I was at something of a disadvantage.

26
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,215
I was fighting against four yakuza.

27
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,344
They got serious,
even though I was just a kid.

28
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,389
But then,
just when I thought I was a goner...

29
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,477
a hero showed up.

30
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,525
This ordinary looking guy
burst onto the scene...

31
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,655
and knocked those yakuza down in no time.

32
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,826
It turned out...

33
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,244
MITSUYO KUREISHI
MMA FIGHTER

34
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:31,206
...he was a mixed martial artist, known
in Japan at that time as "The White Hope."

35
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,166
I saw you fighting.

36
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,545
You've got some balls, kid.

37
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,465
So... why don't you learn martial arts?

38
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,057
His words changed my life dramatically.

39
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,308
Hey.

40
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,312
AKIRA NISHIHONJI
PRESIDENT, NISHIHONJI SECURITY

41
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,438
How's it going?

42
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,357
Perfect.

43
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,235
This might be the best condition
I've ever been in.

44
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,571
Hey, Cos.

45
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,282
Don't push yourself too hard.

46
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,660
When you think you
don't stand a chance, just quit.

47
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,162
Not that again.

48
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,081
I've told you a hundred times.

49
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:17,460
You're my favorite junior,
you're more than just a fighter.

50
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,799
Have you forgotten...
the sort of personality I have?

51
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,596
I hate losing more than anything.

52
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,599
You're in good hands with me.

53
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,102
I promise to take you
all the way through the championship.

54
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,440
I knew you'd say that.

55
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,525
Go win the battle.

56
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,778
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

57
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,864
KENGAN MATCH

58
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,290
GAME ONE

59
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,418
He's got an infinite desire for combat.

60
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:03,465
He might be short, but he's strong enough
to take down any opponent he fights.

61
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,468
A young jujitsu master...

62
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,472
Can he add to the excitement
of the opening of the tournament?

63
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,684
Standing 171 cm tall and weighing 68 kg,

64
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,939
his kengan match record is
21 wins and no losses.

65
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,487
He has amassed total assets
of 79 billion, 212 million yen.

66
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,407
Representing Nishihonji Security Services,

67
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,118
also known as "The King of Stranglers,"

68
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,039
Cosmo Imai!

69
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,638
All right. Let's get started.

70
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,475
What the hell? He's just a little kid.

71
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,061
Cosmo Imai, 19 years old.

72
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,188
He practices jujitsu.

73
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,441
Despite his appearance,
he's won all 21 matches straight.

74
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,567
I mean...

75
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,528
RONALD HARAGUCHI
PRESIDENT, BOSS BURGER

76
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,321
...he's no match for you, though.

77
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,658
Oh. Jujitsu?

78
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,495
I'll teach him his place,
he's just a cock sucker

79
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,664
who loves to use
ground grappling techniques.

80
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,332
ADAM DUDLEY
BOSS BURGER'S FIGHTER

81
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,292
VERSUS

82
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,340
This man has beaten countless opponents.

83
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,385
He'll take down anyone, armed or unarmed.

84
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,345
He's the Kingpin Brawler in Texas.

85
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,308
The violent thug from the land of the free
will go on a rampage on Ganryu Island.

86
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,355
Will he be the first foreign fighter ever
to win the Kengan Tournament championship?

87
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,609
Standing 192 cm tall
and weighing 107 kg,

88
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,863
his kengan match record
is one win and no losses.

89
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:55,243
The total assets he has acquired
stand at seven billion, 646 million yen.

90
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,871
Representing Boss Burger,

91
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,582
also known as "The Emperor,"

92
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,377
Adam Dudley!

93
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,895
Look at them!
They're already glaring at each other.

94
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:28,026
Hey, what kind of bullshit is this?
Do Japs make their bitches fight?

95
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,278
You've got a foul mouth.

96
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,240
Well, it doesn't matter.
You won't be able to talk in a minute.

97
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,660
Well, well. They're raging.

98
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,956
SHION SORYUIN
CHAIRWOMAN, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

99
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,000
What do you think of this match?

100
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,627
I really love cute guys and tough guys!

101
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,545
TOMOKO MATSUDA,
SECRETARY, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

102
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,048
That's not what I asked.

103
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,718
Where did Kiryu go?

104
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,304
SETSUNA KIRYU
FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

105
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,727
The key to this match is how they bring
the fight to their field of expertise.

106
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,521
SUEKICHI KANEDA
FIGHTER, GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

107
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,649
That's true, seeing as their styles
are the complete opposite of each other.

108
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,317
NAOYA OHKUBO
FIGHTER, MUJI TV NETWORK

109
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,614
The big difference in physique
must surely work against Imai.

110
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,991
What do you think, Ohma?

111
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,080
Physique won't make a difference...

112
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,000
not to a fighting prodigy like Cosmo Imai.

113
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,797
Will the winner be the jujitsu master
of the Land of Rising Sun...

114
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,260
or the bullfighter from
the Land of the Free?

115
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,721
Ready, get set!

116
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,518
This is a face-off between two men
from opposite sides of the Pacific...

117
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,063
with completely opposite fighting styles.

118
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,317
Which one of them will triumph?

119
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,323
Fight!

120
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,955
It's on! The Kengan Life-or-Death
Tournament has finally begun!

121
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,014
Shit! That was a heavy blow.
That didn't feel like a middleweight blow.

122
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,267
Great.
He seems perfectly prepared for this.

123
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,229
I'm used to fighting big guys.

124
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,858
I just need to make sure I avoid
getting hit from the front

125
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,110
and try to throw him off-balance.

126
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,653
Quick little bitch.

127
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,246
He seems well prepared
for a heavyweight match.

128
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,625
We don't mesh with each other.

129
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,044
Fine.

130
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,339
I'm going to force you to mesh with me!

131
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,715
Okay.

132
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,884
Your eyeballs are mine.

133
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,889
Nice. A scissor throw!

134
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,349
Hell, yeah! He did it, Wakatsuki.

135
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,892
JUN SEKIBAYASHI
FIGHTER, GANDAI

136
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,268
Calm down, Seki. I saw it.

137
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,395
TAKESHI WAKATSUKI
FIGHTER, FURUMI PHARMA

138
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,521
He's got momentum.

139
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,691
From here on in,
they're in Imai's field of expertise.

140
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:15,985
He has him pinned!

141
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,571
Ground grappling techniques
are Imai's forte.

142
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,242
He's living up to the name of Cosmo
with these universe-class techniques.

143
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,619
Is there anything Adam can do?

144
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,831
That guy looks familiar for some reason.

145
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,000
JERRY TYSON, 22ND CENTURY FAX'S FIGHTER
(ELIMINATED)

146
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,503
All right. I've scaled the mountain.

147
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,339
This is over.

148
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,220
Who said it's over?

149
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,099
Save the speech
until you actually take me down.

150
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,481
Okay. That was my plan, anyway.

151
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,276
From now on, I'm in charge.

152
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,741
Wow. This match is
starting to get pretty one-sided.

153
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,287
Imai's on the offensive,
showering Adam with blows.

154
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,664
Is it all over for Adam?

155
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,834
He's not letting his guard down.

156
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,462
I can't move onto a stranglehold.

157
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,965
What's wrong, boy?

158
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,304
You couldn't even kill a mouse
with your pussy punches.

159
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,930
What?

160
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,400
Why did he dodge such a little jab?

161
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,862
What's happened? Imai has dismounted.

162
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,614
Was he too concerned about
attacks coming from below?

163
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,161
Why did he avoid that punch
when it wouldn't have done much damage?

164
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,415
You should've taken his arm at the moment
of impact and moved into the Arm Bar.

165
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,126
That was the right response.

166
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,587
REI MIKAZUCHI AND RINO KURAYOSHI
OF GOLD PLEASURE GROUP

167
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,465
If he hadn't dodged that blow,
this match could've been over.

168
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,507
Oh, really?

169
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,180
He hardly touched me,
so why does it hurt this much?

170
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,395
What is going on?

171
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,900
Adam is getting back up
in a very unnatural way.

172
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,235
What the hell is his body made of?

173
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,156
His fighting spirit
has finally been ignited.

174
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,077
Now, Adam, show them your power.

175
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,958
Sorry, boy.
We're back in my area of expertise.

176
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,592
That man is...

177
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,563
Ice hockey is the only
modern sport in the world

178
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:02,235
where players are silently
authorized to hit each other.

179
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:07,949
However, the coefficient of friction
on an ice-rink is only 0.005.

180
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,786
In an environment where
you can barely keep your balance,

181
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,914
you can't throw powerful punches.

182
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,290
However...

183
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:25,508
Adam Dudley managed to deliver a large
number of knockouts on the rink.

184
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,762
The secret to his skill
was his well-built trunk.

185
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,475
Adam has an abnormally large
erector spinae muscle.

186
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,395
It greatly increases
the conductivity efficiency of force,

187
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:43,317
making his jabs powerful enough
to knock his opponents out cold.

188
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,282
Don't stop moving.
Shake him off with my speed...

189
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,910
until I take him down!

190
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,081
Good. Keep throwing him off!

191
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,919
Stop teasing me, boy.

192
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,596
He bounced!

193
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,183
Adam hit Imai with
the full force of his strength.

194
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:20,480
Imai was slammed to the ground
so hard that he bounced!

195
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,862
That was one hell of a blow.
I couldn't protect myself.

196
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,866
-Imai. Can you keep fighting?
-I have to recover quickly.

197
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,619
I need to get back on...

198
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,794
Imai's been blown away again!

199
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,299
He jumped back to reduce the damage.

200
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,051
Wait. When did you get the microphone?

201
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,848
Don't underestimate me!

202
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,065
I can't back off or I'll lose.
All I can do is keep attacking.

203
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,446
Look at you now, Imai.

204
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,993
Adam's taken down plenty of
heavyweight fighters back in the U.S.

205
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,081
So easy to take wimps down.

206
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,712
I was going to recruit Punk Abbot
to be our fighter.

207
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,509
He had kengan match experience too.

208
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,887
But I met a man
with such incredible physical ability

209
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,098
that he was a lethal killing machine.

210
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,101
That man was Adam Dudley.

211
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,397
On top of that, your physical specs
can't even compare to Adamâ€™s.

212
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,400
No matter how good your technique is,

213
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,404
Adam is capable of turning
the tables with a single blow.

214
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,826
You're just a piece of paper to Adam.

215
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,372
He's a rock that beats
the shit out of paper.

216
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,970
Crap. He's tougher than I expected.

217
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:20,308
If this match lasts much longer,
I'll be at a disadvantage.

218
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:29,150
I'll show you... what I'm capable of.

219
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:36,157
Look at Imai. He's adopted a low stance.

220
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,661
Wow. Ready to die, boy?

221
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,331
I'll play along.

222
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,167
Adam has changed his stance, too.

223
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:51,839
It looks like they're both determined
to end this match with their next strike.

224
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,215
I see.

225
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,192
They're moving.

226
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,446
High-Stick Shot.

227
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,448
Zone Activated.

228
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:28,709
He's done it!
He's been taken down!

229
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,549
He's been hit by cruel reality.

230
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:41,889
Even a miraculous technique is useless
in the face of overwhelming power.

231
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,022
This is a perfect sandbag for me.

232
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,026
What's the matter, kid? Fight back!

233
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,237
-The best is yet to come!
-That's enough.

234
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,825
Come on, referee. You can't stop me now.

235
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,496
That's enough.

236
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,250
What the hell is happening?

237
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,461
Adam Dudley didn't understand it...

238
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,589
until he saw it.

239
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,638
No shit.

240
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,932
That's...

241
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,727
That's me.

242
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,604
He's down!

243
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,941
Imai executed a perfect Triangle Choke!

244
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,611
The King of Stranglers, Cosmo Imai,

245
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,073
showed his pride
in being a jujitsu master.

246
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,243
That was an awesome way to end it.

247
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:49,582
Yeah. Adam probably hasn't even
realized yet that he was attacked.

248
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,961
"Zone" is such a tricky technique.

249
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,338
What is zone?

250
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,842
It's the technique of discerning
the interval of less than 0.1 second

251
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,803
when the opponent is focused
exclusively on his attack,

252
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,765
and sneaking into the blind spot
of their conscious mind.

253
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,603
As a result, Cosmo managed to
disappear from his opponent's sight.

254
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,148
Adam probably didn't even realize

255
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:20,154
that his perception and reality
had gone in opposite directions.

256
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,365
When Adam was caught unawares,

257
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,743
Cosmo instantly moved into
a Triangle Choke.

258
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,871
The whole process took
a fraction of a second.

259
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,165
Hey, Wakatsuki.

260
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,168
Do you think you can pull that off, too?

261
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:39,131
No. Imai's the only one
who can fight that way.

262
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,802
The winner is Cosmo Imai.

263
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,847
Cosmo Imai. He's definitely a prodigy.

264
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,603
Oh no. We lost!

265
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:04,031
-Imai, well done!
-You're the best, Cosmo!

266
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,368
Nice work, Cos.
I guess it was a narrow win.

267
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,745
Once you get some rest,
let's go out to eat...

268
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,374
Cos!

269
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,381
I've never seen him
so badly injured after a fight.

270
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,175
This tournament...

271
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,846
is on a higher level than I imagined.

272
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:06,862
PREVIEW

273
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,114
The battle of a hermit versus a riot cop.

274
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,575
Which one is going to win,

275
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,287
the unstoppable spear or
the unbreakable shield?

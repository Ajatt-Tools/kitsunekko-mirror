1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,934
Although we're all very worried
about Mokichi's condition,

2
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,061
the fourth game is starting soon!

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,938
SAYAKA KATAHARA
DAUGHTER OF METSUDO KATAHARA

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,191
RESERVED FOR OHMA TOKITA
YAMASHITA CORPORATION

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,611
You look pretty good
in the shorts I gave you.

6
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,697
OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,741
You'll be called soon, Ohma.

8
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,701
KAEDE AKIYAMA
CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY, NOGI GROUP

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,412
-Okay, I'm off now.
-Um... Ohma.

10
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,414
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORP.

11
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,959
I know I shouldn't be saying
this to you right before your match,

12
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,462
but if you ever feel your life is in
danger, you must withdraw from the game.

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:51,385
Your life... is much more important
to me than money.

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,430
Kazuo Yamashita.

15
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:59,351
-Stop interfering.
-You think I'm interfering?

16
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,062
-I'm just worried about--
-I won't lose.

17
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,775
Think about how you're going
to reward me when I win.

18
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,744
SUKIZO URITA
PRESIDENT, PENASONIC CORPORATION

19
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,916
It's been a while since I've
seen you walk on two legs.

20
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,627
Inaba.

21
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,381
I badly want to win this tournament.

22
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,426
-I'm counting on you.
-Got it!

23
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,886
RYO INABA
FIGHTER, PENASONIC CORPORATION

24
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,432
Well, we'd better get going, too.

25
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,183
Hi, Mr. Yamashita.

26
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:46,189
You're, um... Mr. Urita,
the president of Penasonic Corporation.

27
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,861
-Is there something I can do for you?
-I have a proposal.

28
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,073
How about a bet, just
between the two of us?

29
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,659
Did you say... a bet?

30
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,872
Private betting between individuals
is not one of the prohibited activities.

31
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,248
She's right.

32
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,126
I just thought we could have a little fun.

33
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,587
-Hmm.
-I'll bet...

34
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:13,091
ten TVs from our company.

35
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,054
-Ten TVs!
-That sounds great!

36
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,016
To be honest,
I've been wanting to get a Penasonic TV.

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,144
Has he been waiting for this opportunity?

38
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,856
Okay, Mr. Yamashita.

39
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,109
Then, what are you
prepared to bet in return?

40
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,112
Let me see...

41
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,743
If I lose, I'll give you the equivalent
to what the TVs are worth.

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,247
-What do you say?
-That's fine. It's a bet.

43
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,877
I proposed the bet to see
the caliber of the man.

44
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,880
I didn't expect him
to accept it so easily.

45
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,593
-That was very stupid.
-It's not a problem.

46
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:01,139
It's only ten TVs. It's peanuts
compared to what I already owe.

47
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,935
He was using
Kengan Association code words.

48
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,979
When someone offers
a product from "our company",

49
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,731
they mean shares in that company.

50
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,316
Shares?

51
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:16,780
And the number means the percentage.
Which means...

52
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,743
you've just accepted a high stakes gamble
betting ten percent of Penasonic's shares.

53
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,912
What? No!

54
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,583
Penasonic Corporation is
the biggest electronics company in Japan,

55
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,919
and he's betting
ten percent of their shares?

56
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,340
By the way, based on Penasonic
Corporation's current stock price,

57
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,593
the amount you'd pay
if you lose is about...

58
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,179
Two hundred and eighty billion yen.

59
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,902
ASHURA

60
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:27,160
Let us present the man who is going
to whip up a storm in the kengan field.

61
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,163
He was the driving force behind
this tournament.

62
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,331
GAME FOUR

63
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,335
He's finally making his grand entrance.

64
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,588
His background is completely unknown.

65
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:43,677
This mysterious new fighter promises
to be a sensation in the tournament.

66
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,557
Standing 182 cm tall and weighing 85 kg,

67
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,185
his kengan match record is
two wins and no losses.

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,108
He has acquired total assets
of 154 billion, 230 million yen.

69
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,028
Representing Yamashita Corporation,
also known as "The Ashura,"

70
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,032
Ohma Tokita!

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,458
SETSUNA KIRYU
FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

72
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,459
Ohma, my love!

73
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,879
You look perfectly prepared.
I want you so much right now!

74
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,922
TOMOKO MATSUDA
CHAIRWOMAN'S SECRETARY, KOUOU EDU.

75
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,467
He's a menacing assassin monster.

76
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,346
His appearance has been much-anticipated.

77
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,516
Penasonic Corporation,
unbeaten in six years,

78
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,270
has sent a new thug to the tournament.

79
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,273
His only desire is to be the champion.

80
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,527
Standing 155 cm tall and weighing 62 kg,

81
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,864
he makes his kengan match debut today.

82
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:51,119
Representing Penasonic Corporation,
also known as "The Black Phantom,"

83
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,956
Ryo Inaba!

84
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,048
Huh?

85
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,178
No!

86
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,263
KEIZABURO SAWADA
FIGHTER, MURDER MUSIC

87
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,515
He's so creepy looking.
He's definitely not my type.

88
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,017
What would you do if he were?

89
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,727
YOSHIKO TOGAWA
PRESIDENT, MURDER MUSIC

90
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,484
He's small.

91
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,654
But that means nothing.

92
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,740
I know what he is, the way I always know.

93
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,410
Not by anything cheap like logic,
but by intuition...

94
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,498
This jerk is strong.

95
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,626
Take your stance!

96
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,136
Fight!

97
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,612
This is a fierce exchange of blows!

98
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,365
It's been an even match so far.

99
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,367
No, she's wrong.

100
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,372
Ohma is superior.

101
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,751
This is his chance!

102
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,503
Go Ohma!

103
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,223
His movement is...

104
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,351
Shit!

105
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,944
Look! Inaba's moves have changed.

106
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,998
Inaba's tactics seem
to be working effectively.

107
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,042
With a hit-and-retreat strategy,

108
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,587
he's trying to slowly but surely
wear Ohma out.

109
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,714
Okay, keep going.

110
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,846
Ohma looks frustrated
at not getting a chance to attack.

111
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,140
He can't seem to hide his irritation.

112
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,851
COSMO IMAI &amp; AKIRA NISHIHONJI
NISHIHONJI SECURITY SERVICES

113
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,520
That's a unique technique
in the Inaba Style, called Edging.

114
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,938
Have you seen it before, Akira?

115
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,983
Yeah, it looks similar to shuffling,

116
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,613
but what makes it unique is that
they move only by using their toes.

117
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,496
Whoa! Ohma hit him!

118
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,793
I see.

119
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,879
Ohma was measuring intervals
by clicking his tongue.

120
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,967
Inaba tried to confuse Ohma by changing
the length and speed of his steps.

121
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,429
But unfortunately for you, your
opponent isn't so easy to fool, Inaba.

122
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,016
Your style won't work
against the Niko Style.

123
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,643
NIKO STYLE - FLAME KATA: FLASHFIRE!

124
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,729
You might want to try
a different trick now.

125
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,608
That won't work anymore.

126
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,113
Oh, you're going back to
what you used to be like,

127
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,115
my darling Ohma Tokita.

128
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,370
Great! Ohma's got his momentum back.

129
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,504
What's wrong, kombu boy?

130
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,298
Is the sideshow over?

131
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,508
Got him!

132
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,931
Whoa, what's happening over there?

133
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,851
Why did he stop?

134
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,020
What? It's his hair!

135
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:52,402
Inaba's hair is wrapped around Ohma's leg!

136
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,779
It's "Spider's Hair", in the Inaba Style.

137
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,907
This is your first experience
fighting hair, isn't it?

138
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,410
Ohma Tokita.

139
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,881
Time to switch offense and defense.

140
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,884
Oh, gosh! He's so cute!

141
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,469
Switch what?

142
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,848
I have no desire at all
to shift to defense.

143
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,145
Were you going to tear my hair out?

144
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,397
It's impossible.

145
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,900
His hair has thrown Tokita into the air!

146
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,402
NIKO STYLE - ADAMANTINE KATA:
INDESTRUCTIBLE

147
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,991
I knew the Adamantine Kata
wasn't my thing.

148
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,910
I didn't tighten my muscles enough.

149
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,542
I'm going to punish you.

150
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,253
That hair is no ordinary hair.

151
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,673
It's a chain!

152
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,638
Hair is the strongest part
of the human body.

153
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,516
The load-bearing capacity
of a single hair is about 150 grams.

154
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,604
A person has 100,000 hairs on average.

155
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:15,902
Theoretically, that means
a person's hair can hold 15 tons.

156
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,781
The Inaba Family pass all
their secrets on to a single child.

157
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,410
From childhood, he strengthens his hair
by rubbing a wondrous ointment into it.

158
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,457
The enhanced hair becomes steel wire
when twined, and can be used as a whip.

159
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,794
It's literally their one and only weapon.

160
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,421
Yeah, all right.

161
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,010
NIKO STYLE - FLAME KATA: RAGING FIRE!!

162
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,140
Were you hoping to achieve something
when you entered my space?

163
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,184
That isn't possible.

164
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,186
And this too is impossible!

165
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,330
He keeps whipping!

166
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,333
Ohma is having a difficult time
coping with the hair whipping.

167
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,797
It seems our bet is going to result
in a victory for me, Mr. Yamashita.

168
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,011
Is he grinning?

169
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,888
What's making him so relaxed?

170
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:33,021
If I lose, I'll be the king of debt.

171
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:35,940
No!

172
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,359
He can't breathe.

173
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,946
Now you understand, Ohma Tokita.

174
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,075
When it comes to pure power,
you are stronger than Inaba.

175
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,577
But...

176
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,497
Inaba will have you beaten before
you have had a chance to use your power.

177
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,667
He is the epitome
of what it is to be an assassin!

178
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,588
Ohma... why aren't you using "that"?

179
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:04,052
I feel like my body is being ripped apart.

180
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,596
This little runt.

181
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,182
He's quite something.

182
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,978
You passed!

183
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,733
I recognize your talent, Ryo Inaba.

184
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,987
Listen, Ohma.

185
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,573
NIKO TOKITA
OHMA'S MASTER OF NIKO STYLE

186
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,950
When you fight,
you should finish it quickly.

187
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,411
It's simply the easiest way.

188
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,955
Niko.

189
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,667
As I thought,
you and I differ on many things.

190
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,838
It's not fun for me at all
if I finish it quickly!

191
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,092
I have to thank you, Ryo Inaba.

192
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,554
It's been ages
since I've been this excited.

193
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,402
Come on!

194
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,530
I'll make you excited, too!

195
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,740
That's what I want.

196
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,672
HEART, STOMACH, LIVER, PANCREAS

197
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,800
While losing consciousness,

198
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,678
Inaba experiences a strange sensation.

199
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,308
It's the opposite of the steely feeling
he gets while assassinating.

200
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,520
It's more like a burning feeling.

201
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,694
By training tirelessly
and fighting through hell,

202
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,364
he's devoted his whole life
to acquiring his skills and power.

203
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,491
None of them will work now.

204
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,370
INABA STYLE: SOMERSAULT KICK

205
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,002
He's incredibly strong.

206
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,423
Darn it.

207
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,388
NIKO STYLE - REDIRECTION &amp; FLAME KATAS

208
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,517
WILL-O'-THE-WISP

209
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,645
No...

210
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,814
No, Inaba.

211
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,277
What happened?

212
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,907
I had no chance against him.

213
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,703
But actually, it's... not so bad.

214
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,377
Did you have fun?

215
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,588
Ryo Inaba.

216
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,049
The game is over.

217
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,511
The winner is Ohma Tokita.

218
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,014
If you want to fight me again,
come and see me anytime.

219
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,641
Welcome back.

220
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,561
These ten years have felt so long to me.

221
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,689
You've finally come back!

222
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,775
That day...

223
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,362
you threw me into the depths of despair.

224
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,490
But this time, finally...

225
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,036
I won't let anyone get in my way.

226
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,372
Ohma Tokita.

227
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,210
So, Dad's pawn won.

228
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,547
KENZO YAMASHITA, KAZUO'S ELDEST SON AND
THE REAL PRESIDENT OF UNDER MOUNT INC

229
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,631
Which means...

230
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,883
YAMASHITA CORPORATION

231
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,052
RAIAN KURE, UNDER MOUNT INC

232
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,428
Ohma.

233
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,057
At this rate, we're going to win
the second stage, too.

234
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,100
Okay.

235
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,186
Congratulations, Mr. Yamashita.

236
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,606
Oh, Mr. Urita.

237
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:50,945
I never even dreamed...
that we would fall in the first round.

238
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,822
Who's this?

239
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,701
He's Mr. Urita, Ryo Inaba's employer.

240
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,413
I have this to give to you, as promised.

241
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,540
Oh, that's right!

242
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,918
I was so excited about Ohma's victory
that I forgot all about it.

243
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,715
I succeeded in obtaining a ten percent
share in Penasonic Corporation.

244
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,841
We don't want that.

245
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,511
I don't know what you've got there,

246
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,097
but we don't care about
anything like that.

247
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,599
What do you mean?

248
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,645
Ryo Inaba and I didn't fight
for stuff like that.

249
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,567
We wanted to know who was stronger.
That was all.

250
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,988
Don't bring that shit into our fight.

251
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:39,243
What on earth is he saying?

252
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,786
It's not just me.

253
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,664
I know this guy thinks the same.

254
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,001
How did you come to that conclusion?

255
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,546
Mr. Yamashita. You really are a great man.

256
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,924
How could he believe that either?

257
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,637
In this mood,
I don't even know how I feel about this.

258
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,974
But you should respect
the result of the bet.

259
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,685
I beg you to take this.

260
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,315
Well, I'm not sure
what you are talking about.

261
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,653
I don't remember making a bet with you.

262
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,575
There wasn't any bet between us
in the first place.

263
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:24,622
We have to respect the will of
the fighters who shed their blood, right?

264
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,667
Now... we're off.

265
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,300
You have defeated me utterly,
Kazuo Yamashita.

266
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,594
What a broad-minded man.

267
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,347
I am so stupid!

268
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,558
That was my big chance to clear my debt.

269
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,602
Hey, Kazuo Yamashita.

270
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,397
Thanks.

271
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,819
Okay, I know.

272
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,031
I can't go against him.

273
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,712
Inaba was...

274
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,007
my best friend.

275
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:48,933
I was well aware that his family,
the Inaba, were a clan of assassins

276
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,728
which had served my family,
the Urita, for generations.

277
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,316
Setting that fact aside,

278
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,196
I believed
our friendship would last forever.

279
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,785
What?

280
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,455
What do you mean?

281
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,502
My dad failed in his mission and died.

282
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:22,633
I became the head
of the Inaba Family yesterday. And so...

283
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,721
as of today, you are my boss.

284
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,352
I obey you, Urita.

285
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,188
If you command it...

286
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,067
I will kill anyone.

287
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,778
Don't...

288
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,031
Don't insult me! You kombu head!

289
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,741
Kombu?

290
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,246
I've never thought of you
as my subordinate

291
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,249
or, needless to say, as a murderer!

292
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:03,007
For so long, you've been my best friend.

293
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,347
Don't say things like that to me
ever again, please.

294
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,057
I'm begging you.

295
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,519
Urita...

296
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,732
Sorry.

297
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,160
Where am I?

298
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,413
You're in the medical suite
in the Kengan Dome.

299
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,625
Oh, right... I lost.

300
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,462
Don't worry. We'll get another chance.

301
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,798
Huh? What's happened to you, Urita?

302
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,926
You look oddly happy.

303
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,181
Yeah, I was just remembering the old days.

304
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,768
Yeah? What a coincidence.

305
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,980
I was also dreaming of the old days.

306
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,904
PREVIEW

307
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,656
Off-field brawls are also welcome!

308
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,282
The gorgeous Bird of Darkness.

309
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,867
A totally wacky beast.

310
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,911
The legendary Genocider.

311
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,537
Do you all see?

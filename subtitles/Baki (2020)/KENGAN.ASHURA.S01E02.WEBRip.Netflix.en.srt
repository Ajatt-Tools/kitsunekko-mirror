1
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,805
Hey.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:18,185
-You brought your buddies today?
-Pardon?

3
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,397
What!

4
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,024
Who are those people?

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,069
What do you want?

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,029
Soliciting? No thanks.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,366
I'll take this. Don't interfere.

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,535
All right.

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,038
I see it... a fighterâ€™s spirit.

10
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,916
Wait, hold on a second.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,169
Is it possible that he is Ivan Karaev?

12
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,420
You know him?

13
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,342
He's a Russian kickboxer
who's been standing out recently.

14
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,302
What is he doing here?

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,012
Nothing personal.

16
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,098
This is just business.

17
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,850
You're going to have to stay in bed
for a while.

18
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,686
Watch out, Ohma!

19
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,981
Ivan's high-kick is known as
the Reaper's Sickle.

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,242
You did too many high-kicks
and forgot about defense.

21
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,995
You are a diligent fighter.

22
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,247
So?

23
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,500
You want to fight, too?

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,211
You're really good.

25
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,463
I like it.

26
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,674
Huh?

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,802
I told you not to interfere.

28
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,804
You can't beat him down.

29
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,808
Don't you dare look down on--

30
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,736
With that amount of blood loss,
he must have got the arteries.

31
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,822
Jeez. He's useless.

32
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,617
I hate to watch a loser struggle in vain.

33
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,869
Be careful, Ohma.

34
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,747
He's got a knife with him.

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,542
Relax, pops. We didn't come here to fight.

36
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,544
I'm Lihito.

37
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,673
I'm going to be your opponent
in the upcoming kengan match.

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,216
Oh.

39
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,678
By the way, my real name is undisclosed.

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,473
L... Lihito?

41
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,809
He's going to be Ohma's opponent?

42
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,522
He seems like an interesting dude.
I'm excited to fight with him.

43
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:02,951
SUPER HUMAN

44
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,960
THE DAY OF THE KENGAN MATCH

45
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,141
KAZUO YAMASHITA
NOGI PUBLICATIONS

46
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,644
Good to see you again, Mr. Nogi.

47
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,063
Is that Komada's replacement?

48
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,983
I can see a good fighter's spirit in him.

49
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,569
Mr. Yoshitake, I'm sorry to tell you,

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,822
but we are going to win again today.

51
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,619
I like your confidence.

52
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,122
But don't underestimate Lihito.

53
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,167
That's Yoshiro Yoshitake.

54
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,712
He's the white hope
of the real estate industry.

55
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,757
Excuse me, Ms. Akiyama?

56
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,177
What is the wager on today's match?

57
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,179
You haven't heard?

58
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,597
Well, no...

59
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,768
They're wagering the construction rights
to the New Makunouchi Building,

60
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,104
a skyscraper to be built here
after the demolition of this building.

61
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,942
The total project cost is going to be
around 100 billion yen.

62
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,987
A hundred billion yen?

63
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,741
Their sense of money is
in a whole other universe.

64
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,205
What's about to happen
is not just a fistfight.

65
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,208
It's a 100-billion-yen slugfest!

66
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,522
Sir, who are those people?

67
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,067
They are members of
the Kengan Association.

68
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,277
What is that?

69
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,322
It's the operating committee
of kengan matches.

70
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,784
All the members are the heads of
prestigious companies.

71
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,581
Right. They sure look like billionaires.

72
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:18,295
It's customary for the association members
to come out and witness the match results.

73
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,964
But that's just an ostensible reason.

74
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,926
These matches have always been
a source of entertainment, too.

75
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,931
Frankly speaking,
they bet on the match results.

76
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,895
You can see they get more heated
when money is involved.

77
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,898
Who the hell is that guy
fighting for the Nogi Group?

78
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,901
-What happened to Komada?
-We want him!

79
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,487
-Lihito!
-Show us another brutal fight.

80
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,159
Lihito's on five wins and no losses.

81
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,328
He's quite a popular fighter now.

82
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,872
Do you think it was really a good idea?

83
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,206
What was?

84
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,294
We didn't tell Ohma
about Lihito's secret weapon.

85
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,420
It doesn't matter.

86
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,174
This match is a litmus test
for Ohma Tokita.

87
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,217
If he can't be the winner,

88
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,890
he will never be the standard-bearer
to lead me to my ambitious goals.

89
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,726
Are you ready?

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,315
Yo, Tokita. I feel bad for you guys.

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,234
Your boss is going to lose
a lot of money for sure.

92
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,154
You're looking good today.

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,949
I'm glad that I waited until today
to beat you up.

94
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,330
Ready, set...

95
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,925
Fight!

96
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,140
-Just start fighting now!
-Why aren't you moving?

97
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,850
Do your freaking job!

98
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,520
They are not moving.

99
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,690
You're wrong.
They've already started fighting.

100
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,193
Watching.

101
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,861
Shifting weight.

102
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,113
Taking stances.

103
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,867
They've been tuning up
since before the match started.

104
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:19,040
Constraining each other's movement
resulted in a deadlock.

105
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,711
It's almost like a face-off
between two master fencers

106
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,463
where a single stroke of sword
determines the winner.

107
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,093
They're watching for the right moment
to initiate an attack.

108
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,554
Ohma.

109
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,228
Mr. Nogi, you are going to be
a stepping stone

110
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,356
to my further growth.

111
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,662
They'll move.

112
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,875
-Both moved!
-Ohma was faster.

113
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,215
He endured Ohma's punch.

114
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,968
He moved toward the blow

115
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,556
to throw Ohma's timing off
and reduced the damage.

116
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,561
In addition, he has his own
unique and eccentric blows.

117
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,272
He has innate abilities
of both offense and defense.

118
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,818
Lihito's on an incredibly
high level as a striker.

119
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,155
However...

120
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,912
Yes!

121
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:46,169
If this was just a fistfight, nobody
would stand a chance of beating Lihito.

122
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,213
But this is more than that.

123
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,547
No way. Lihito's losing.

124
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,716
That Ohma guy's strong.

125
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,927
You're a pretty good fighter.

126
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,139
But I've taken down so many fighters
who were as good as you.

127
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,766
You're nailing it, Ohma!

128
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,810
He's barely hanging on.

129
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,020
Is this all you got?

130
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,660
What happened?

131
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,621
He's bleeding as if
a blade gouged out his flesh.

132
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,956
He used it.

133
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,583
Let's see if it gives Lihito an advantage

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,252
or not.

135
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,588
This shape of the scar...

136
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,174
You scraped off my flesh

137
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,592
with your fingertips.

138
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,933
There are three major kinds of
grip strengths.

139
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,437
Firstly, crushing power is the strength
to squeeze objects by hand.

140
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,525
Secondly, holding power is the strength
to catch hold of objects.

141
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:55,405
Lastly, pinching power is
the strength of fingertips.

142
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,534
Lihito's pinching power is
far beyond human capabilities.

143
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,455
Climbing up a sheer cliff is
as easy as falling off a log for him.

144
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,958
He truly is a superhuman!

145
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,129
Imagine what would happen if he used
the superhuman power to attack people.

146
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,091
Wherever Lihito's finger touches
becomes their vital spot.

147
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,972
Whether it's flesh or bone,
he can cut through it.

148
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,725
His fingers cut as sharply as razors.

149
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,562
That's his special ability,
which is called:

150
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,481
the Razor's Edge.

151
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,984
Play time is over!

152
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,779
Lihito, rip him up with your Razor's Edge!

153
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:42,285
The crowds know about his ability.
This isn't his first time doing that.

154
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,038
That man kept this from me
on purpose, huh?

155
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,791
You better focus on me.

156
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,628
In return for beating me up
so many times earlier,

157
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,588
I'm going to mince you into pieces.

158
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,048
I see.

159
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,886
That wasn't a knife
but Lihito's technique.

160
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,850
I have no idea how it works but he can
rip human flesh apart with his hand.

161
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,519
What is Ohma going to do?

162
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,899
Is there a way to get
the upper hand on the razor?

163
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,282
Take him down, Lihito!

164
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,625
He's bleeding too much.

165
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,752
He can't last much longer.

166
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,092
Don't let yourself get carried away!

167
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,057
-What's wrong?
-Just beat him!

168
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,601
That's one hell of a kick.

169
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,855
Good thing I put my right hand in
when you kicked me.

170
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,609
Now you're the loser.

171
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,405
He attacked Ohma while getting kicked?

172
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,993
What a guy! He's like an armed beast.

173
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,620
He's completely guarded.

174
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,582
Lihito has no blind spots.

175
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,877
He can hit, dodge and shave flesh off.

176
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,131
Prepare to be diced.

177
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,510
You managed to protect
your tendon from me?

178
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,221
Good job, human.

179
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,390
Did you call me human?

180
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,393
-It sounds like you are not--
-That's right.

181
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,315
I'm not a human.

182
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,820
I was 11 years old
when I first tore a coin apart.

183
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,073
I didn't train myself for that.

184
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,117
I could just do it.

185
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:52,749
So, that means I was born
with my pinching power.

186
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,959
Do you understand?

187
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,545
I'm on a whole different level of strength

188
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,840
from you and the others
from the beginning.

189
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,846
For a human, you did well
fighting against a superhuman like me.

190
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,726
I'll tell you my real name as your reward.

191
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,521
It's Ichiro Nakata.

192
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,734
That's a good name.
Why did you change it to Lihito?

193
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,155
Superheroes don't use
their real names, you know?

194
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:29,077
As a superhuman,
I decided to go by a hero name.

195
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,872
Lihito means a man
who surpasses human principles.

196
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,249
Just like me, huh?

197
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,667
LIHITO

198
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,295
You're such a chatterbox.

199
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,882
A hero doesn't speak much.

200
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,050
What?

201
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,929
You're the superhuman?
Don't talk nonsense.

202
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,641
Humans aren't that easy
for the likes of you to surpass.

203
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:58,940
Says the man who's powerless
before my Razor's Edge.

204
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,359
I've found a way to beat it.

205
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,781
I was waiting to see
if you have other abilities.

206
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,282
You disappointed me.

207
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,459
Hey, you're in my space.

208
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,554
Lihito, finish him off!

209
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
You don't need to tell me.

210
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,517
I'll mince you.

211
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,562
-We've won!
-Good.

212
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,111
It didn't work?

213
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,863
What the hell?

214
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,163
Lihito's pinch grip surely is incredible.

215
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,916
But in order to rip through things,

216
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,503
it requires distance for acceleration
in addition to finger strength.

217
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,257
In other words,
without having enough distance,

218
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,302
he can't even cut through tofu.

219
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,183
Now you're just a human,
Ichiro Nakata.

220
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,483
He doesn't need the Razor's Edge.
He's still way stronger than Ohma.

221
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,818
It's a piece of cake.

222
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:43,211
The association members have observed
many deadly kengan matches before.

223
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:48,090
Now they are left bewildered
by the inexplicable sight before them.

224
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:55,389
Lihito initiated the attacks, but somehow,
he's being attacked.

225
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:03,314
Apart from Lihito, few spectators
noticed what's happening.

226
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,406
Ohma waited for his opponent
to make a move

227
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:17,620
and added a few grams of pressure
to set Lihito's power to go off.

228
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,208
That disrupted the power flow,
making it uncontrollable.

229
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,046
Ohma Tokita.

230
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,259
This guy has perfect control
over the flow of power.

231
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,511
That's no human work.

232
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,762
Lihito!

233
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,014
What the hell are you doing?
Fight back!

234
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,642
That's not going to happen.

235
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,938
It's already over.

236
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,196
The match is over.

237
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,283
The winner is Ohma Tokita.

238
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,119
He won!

239
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,872
He passed... for now.

240
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,293
Lihito, did you feel it?

241
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,171
That was the technique beyond principle.

242
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:17,847
WINNER: OHMA OF NOGI GROUP
LOSER: LIHITO OF YOSHITAKE REAL ESTATE

243
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:23,269
NOGI GROUP WON THE CONSTRUCTION RIGHTS
TO THE NEW MAKUNOUCHI BUILDING

244
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,361
Here. Have another cup.

245
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,904
Thank you.

246
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:40,202
No, I should thank you
for bringing the money all the way here.

247
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,497
Ohma, why don't you ask them
to send it by wire transfer?

248
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,791
I can't be bothered.

249
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,545
You are the one who's bothering her.

250
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,838
I'm fine.

251
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,926
There's actually something
I wanted to ask Ohma.

252
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,932
There are 1,205 fighters
registered to kengan matches.

253
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,145
Each fighter has
8.5 matches a year on average.

254
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:11,025
It's five times as many as the world's
biggest combat sport organization.

255
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,777
Wow, that's a lot.

256
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:18,199
Besides, all the fighters are elites
the association members acknowledged.

257
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,535
Some lose their lives in brutal matches.

258
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,374
A decent amount of remuneration
is promised in return.

259
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,878
To be honest, however, it's far from
enough, considering how grueling they are.

260
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,883
Those who come into this world
of their own accord must be daredevils

261
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,053
or men with some determined purpose.

262
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:45,518
Ohma Tokita, what makes you compete
in kengan matches?

263
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,816
My purpose?

264
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,403
Do I need a reason to fight?

265
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,614
I just want to show who's the strongest.

266
00:19:58,823 --> 00:19:59,949
That's all.

267
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,077
Any other reasons
are just tacked on afterwards.

268
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,453
It's full of lies.

269
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,706
Is that it?

270
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,876
You know you're risking your life, right?

271
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,420
You're wrong.

272
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,758
I will only lose when hell freezes over.

273
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,724
There are 1,205 kengan fighters.

274
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,060
He has to be one of them.

275
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,355
I can't wait to see him again.

276
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,485
KOUOU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

AUDITORIUM

278
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,242
TOSHIO OZU
KENGAN FIGHTER EXAMINER FOR KOUOU GROUP

279
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,838
This is the battle royal of
the fighter applicants

280
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,883
for us, Kouou Education Group.

281
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,719
How did you know about this?

282
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,306
I'll just say "people will talk."

283
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,393
You broke in and knocked out our examiner.

284
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,646
For what? To promote yourself
for the kengan matches?

285
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,106
I want to see him.

286
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,442
Who do you want to see?

287
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:21,655
I heard my old friend had
a kengan match recently.

288
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,868
It seems like he has some misconceptions.

289
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:31,916
We have a lot of catching up to do.
So I want to see him.

290
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,087
Okay. You're our affiliated fighter
from now on.

291
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,925
Are you sure you can decide
such a thing so easily?

292
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,262
I'm Shion Soryuin,
the chairwoman of Kouou.

293
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,515
I'm Setsuna Kiryu.

294
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,267
Pleasure to meet you.

295
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,936
MYSTERIOUS KENGAN FIGHTER

296
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,655
HEADQUARTERS OF NOGI GROUP

297
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:32,620
Your company is wagering
50 billion yen on this match.

298
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:40,002
Even if you did win,
all you get is a one-way ticket to hell.

299
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,296
I think it's insane.

300
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,924
Are you really sure about this, Mr. Nogi?

301
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:50,638
Our opponent is the big gun who has
a kengan record of 57 wins and no losses.

302
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,889
Of course.

303
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,850
We are going to win...

304
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,646
the one-way ticket to hell.

305
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,692
Ohma, this is the final test for you.

306
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,864
Wrestling fans, be proud.

307
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,532
Bring back your dreams.

308
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:15,412
The man with a perfect 57-0 record
meets all of those wishes.

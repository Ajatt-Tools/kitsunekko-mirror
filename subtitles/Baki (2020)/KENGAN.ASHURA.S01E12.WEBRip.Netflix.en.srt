1
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,227
Good. It's all done.

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,978
HAJIME HANAFUSA
UNI OF TEITO'S FIGHTER

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,356
Operation complete.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,941
KOKOMI YOSHIZAWA
NURSE, UNI OF TEITO

5
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:24,942
I'm exhausted.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,197
-Doctor, how is he?
-Don't worry.

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,407
I've managed to bring him back.

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,451
MOKICHI ROBINSON, FIGHTER, SENTORY
(ELIMINATED)

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,953
Your brother is going to be fine.

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,871
ELENA ROBINSON
MOKICHI ROBINSON'S SISTER

11
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:38,830
Thank goodness.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,417
Thank you so much.
I can't thank you enough.

13
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,920
You don't need to thank me.

14
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:50,217
It was a rare opportunity for me to fiddle
around inside a living fighter's body.

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,221
Doctor, don't say such a thing
in front of the family, please.

16
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,642
Look!

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,103
Their match just finished.

18
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,983
That guy...

19
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:42,079
FATHER AND SON

20
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,166
In the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament,

21
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,251
the fifth match of Block A
is about to begin.

22
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,130
The crowd is thrilled to be witnessing
the fight of the century

23
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,341
between two superhuman fighters.

24
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,969
He's a decathlete known as
"The Immeasurable," Gozo Murobuchi.

25
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,596
GOZO MUROBUCHI
FIGHTER, UNITED CLOTHING

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,762
His opponent is a championship contender,

27
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:03,684
Takeshi Wakatsuki,
also known as "Wild Tiger."

28
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,394
TAKESHI WAKATSUKI
FIGHTER, FURUMI PHARMA

29
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,980
Murobuchi is described
as a modern Hercules.

30
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,901
However, he has suffered
one previous defeat.

31
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,529
And the man who defeated
him was Wakatsuki.

32
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,409
His challenge to
his long-standing foe begins now.

33
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,588
We have a winner.

34
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:38,009
The winner is Takeshi Wakatsuki.

35
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,889
That was... just incredible.

36
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,058
OHMA TOKITA &amp; KAZUO YAMASHITA
YAMASHITA CORP.

37
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,435
He hardly seems human.

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,938
Ohma, do you think
you can you beat that guy?

39
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,773
-I'm hungry.
-What?

40
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,819
Wait. Are you sure you don't need
to watch the next match?

41
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,281
Nah. I don't care who I fight.

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,951
Hey, Ohma.
You don't even have your wallet.

43
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,872
Excitement is only going to mount
as the sixth match will start soon!

44
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,249
Oh, it's starting soon.

45
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,297
GAME SIX

46
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,092
This beautiful bird of darkness
dances bewitchingly.

47
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,428
Don't let him get you under his spell.

48
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,139
This devil of a man
is now entering the arena!

49
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,018
Standing 181 cm tall and weighing 74 kg,

50
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,354
his kengan match record is
four wins and no losses.

51
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,398
SAYAKA KATAHARA
DAUGHTER OF METSUDO KATAHARA

52
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,901
He has acquired total assets
of 21 billion, 90 million yen.

53
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,612
Representing Murder Music,

54
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:44,075
also known as "The Bird of Darkness",
Keizaburo Sawada!

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,960
It's finally my turn. I'm so excited.

56
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,545
KEIZABURO SAWADA
FIGHTER, MURDER MUSIC

57
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,299
And now, let's welcome the other fighter.

58
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:06,097
This German muscle monster is
about to let loose in the Far East.

59
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,852
He has the biggest muscles
in human history.

60
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:16,274
No matter how powerful the attack,
it'll have little effect on this man.

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,820
Standing 205 cm tall and weighing 210 kg,

62
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,615
his kengan match record is
51 wins and no losses.

63
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:29,496
He has amassed total assets of
1 trillion, 622 billion, 711 million yen.

64
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,623
Representing Toyo Electric Power Co,

65
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,461
also known as "The Monster,"
Julius Reinhold!

66
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,222
JULIUS REINHOLD
FIGHTER, TOYO ELECTRIC POWER CO

67
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,725
You've got ugly muscles.

68
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,727
Not my type at all.

69
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,688
We have a winner.

70
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:55,981
We what?

71
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,400
Due to Murder Music's default,

72
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:04,281
Julius Reinhold of Toyo Electric Power Co
will advance to the second round.

73
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,325
What the hell did you just say?

74
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,787
That was unexpected.

75
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,622
METSUDO KATAHARA
CHAIRMAN, KENGAN ASSOCIATION

76
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,207
ERIO KURE,
PATRIARCH OF THE KURE FAMILY

77
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,127
Someone's finally taking advantage of
this tournament's idiosyncrasies.

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,005
-Idiosyncrasies?
-Indeed.

79
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:25,093
This is a marathon tournament
spanning eight days in total.

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,805
There is plenty of time
to go on maneuvers.

81
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,266
Shall we penalize Toyo?

82
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,686
That's not necessary.
Let them do as they want.

83
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,692
I revised the rules to make it easier
for them to make deals under the table.

84
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,529
Let them maneuver as much as they like.

85
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,489
YOSHIKO TOGAWA
PRESIDENT, MURDER MUSIC

86
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,408
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

87
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,247
REN NIKAIDO
FIGHTER, BYAKUYA SHIMBUN COMPANY

88
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,579
Your brave decision has
ensured everything will go well.

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,835
Goddamn it. I'm sorry, Sawada.

90
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,839
Good job. We've got one position secured.

91
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,009
Meguro, you're up next.

92
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,679
MASAKI MEGURO
FIGHTER, UMIICHI SECURITIES

93
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,222
Time to break someoneâ€“-

94
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,352
I knew this must be what was going on.

95
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,896
You've gotta be kidding me, assholes.

96
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,315
You ganged up on a woman
and threatened her?

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,525
Do you even have balls? Huh?

98
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,528
What do you want, Keizaburo Sawada?

99
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,199
Ms. Togawa chose to default
of her own free will.

100
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,994
-It's unjust to--
-Shut up, you Chinese jerk.

101
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,748
Don't think you can get away with this
just because you're handsome.

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,626
I'm going to crush both of you.

103
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,002
Both of us?

104
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,672
Don't you mean the three of us?

105
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,467
You've gotta be kidding me.

106
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,137
I kicked him so hard
his brain should be mush.

107
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,641
Yoshiko, stay out of the way.

108
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,811
Sawada, fighting three fighters at once
is too much, even for you.

109
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,188
You know what?

110
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,318
Men don't act out of reason.

111
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,573
Ballet requires more
flexibility than any sport.

112
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,203
If a ballet dancer
acquired kicking skills,

113
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,913
how mighty would they be?

114
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,168
They would surpass
even a first-class martial artist.

115
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,795
What?

116
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,676
Hold on.

117
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,305
Keizaburo Sawada was
my opponent originally.

118
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,560
It makes sense for me to handle this.

119
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,563
I don't need backup.

120
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,735
Fine by me. You'll regret this.

121
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,069
Bring it on.

122
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,738
Take this.

123
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,325
I'm putting extra G-force...

124
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,912
into this fatal attack.

125
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,585
Sawada executed a successful kick
and destroyed Julius's cervical vertebrae.

126
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,546
Or so he thought.

127
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,091
A kick aimed at cervical vertebrae...

128
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,303
Is that your technique?

129
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,476
Techniques, secrets...

130
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,520
You fools are always
talking about those things.

131
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,983
But it's just drivel for the weak,
it's nothing more than that.

132
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,613
The truly strong don't need technique.

133
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,782
Sawada!

134
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,995
Just to be safe,
I'll break your left leg, too.

135
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,541
Darn. I missed.

136
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,128
Another fool to take down?

137
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,424
Oh no! I didn't think
anybody would be there.

138
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,427
I didn't see him
because he was in my blind spot.

139
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,554
They're Yamashita Corporation.

140
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,725
It could be a problem
if something were to happen.

141
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,978
I'll put him to sleep for a while.

142
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,191
I'm terribly sorry.

143
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,692
What?

144
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,531
He predicted perfectly the trajectory
of a needle that's thinner than a hair.

145
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,200
Who is this man?

146
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,829
Huh? I think I just saw something
whiz past.

147
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,165
-I have no choice.
-Nikaido.

148
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,209
That's enough.

149
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,211
KATSUMASA HAYAMI
CHAIRMAN, TOYO ELECTRIC POWER CO

150
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,921
Forget about Yamashita Corporation.

151
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,216
Masaki, you should head to the arena.

152
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:39,472
Your opponent is Muteba Gizenga.
He's a legendary mercenary.

153
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,850
Beat him to your heart's content.

154
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,103
Got it, old man.

155
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,524
You heard him. Let's drop it for now.

156
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,317
There will be no next time.

157
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:57,448
He... forgave me.
He's nicer than he looks.

158
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,288
Oh no! Are you all right?

159
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,086
Let's raise a toast to celebrate
your victory in the first round.

160
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,880
To Ohma!

161
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,468
-You're not joining me?
-I'm starving.

162
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,055
Please let me do
what typical a president would do.

163
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,018
I don't care about all that.
It's not a big deal, anyway.

164
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:29,480
It is. This is a huge step forward
for Yamashita Corporation.

165
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:34,194
Our company needs to pay off
the debt which I was forced into.

166
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,528
Whatever.

167
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,326
Anyway, it was lucky
that Dr. Hanafusa came by.

168
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,497
-I hope Mr. Sawada will get better soon.
-He'll be fine.

169
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,919
He looks shady but I hear
he's actually a very good doctor.

170
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,048
Ohma.

171
00:11:55,673 --> 00:12:00,094
To tell you the truth,
I am very grateful to you.

172
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,059
All I used to do was flatter my boss,
but my life has changed completely.

173
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,189
I've started to see the world
in a different way, as a man.

174
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,692
What, Kazuo?
Do you want to fight, too?

175
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,946
No. Combat sports are not for me.

176
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,322
Says who?

177
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,409
It's only about being strong or weak.
That's all.

178
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,207
News flash from the Kengan
Life-or-Death Tournament.

179
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,253
-We just saw that man.
-We happened to be on the scene, huh?

180
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,880
A surprise attack?

181
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,300
This tournament is getting intense.

182
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,010
Who gives a shit?

183
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,304
It's their fault for getting attacked.

184
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,516
You know you could
get attacked too, Ohma.

185
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,271
Even though you're incredibly strong,
I'm still worried.

186
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,148
You have nothing to worry about, Kazuo.

187
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,568
-You're wrong. You should listen to me.
-You're drunk, aren't you?

188
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:02,699
Despite my appearance,
I'm old enough to be your father.

189
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,119
What's wrong with worrying
about my children?

190
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,830
I don't give a shit
about a father or whatever.

191
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,252
Besides, I'm not your son.

192
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,171
That's true.

193
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:25,013
Actually, I have a son,
though he never leaves his room.

194
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,933
I guess I have no right
to tell you what to do

195
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,477
seeing as I'm not
a good father to my own son.

196
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,523
-Where are you going, Ohma?
-To pee.

197
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,249
I'm Niko Tokita.

198
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,293
Call me Niko.

199
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,170
NIKO TOKITA
OHMA'S MASTER OF NIKO STYLE

200
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,630
You don't have a name, do you?

201
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,761
This area is between
Tokita and Shichi-ohma, right?

202
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,305
Okay. "Ohma."

203
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,892
From now on, you're Ohma Tokita.

204
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,938
Don't act like my father.

205
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,024
Thank you for your patience.

206
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,526
It's time to introduce the next fighters.

207
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,823
GAME SEVEN

208
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,242
Here comes the most
powerful creature in Africa,

209
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:33,581
the murder machine of the dark continent,
the ruthless mammonish warrior.

210
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,710
He has as many names
as there are legends about him.

211
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:43,132
A legendary mercenary is now entering
the kengan match battlefield.

212
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,512
Standing 199 cm tall and weighing 122 kg,

213
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,139
this is his first kengan match appearance.

214
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,142
Representing Iwami Heavy Industries,

215
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:59,190
also known as "The Genocider,"
Muteba Gizenga!

216
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,490
MUTEBA GIZENGA
FIGHTER, IWAMI HEAVY INDUSTRIES

217
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,659
TOMARI TOHGO
PRESIDENT, IWAMI HEAVY INDUSTRIES

218
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,788
Show them, Muteba, that duty and
compassion mean nothing at all.

219
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,458
And that it's the people who work
for money that are truly strong.

220
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,421
Muteba Gizenga, the legendary mercenary.

221
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,133
Looks like Iwami Heavy Industries
dropped a bundle on this.

222
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,344
That Iwami chick is wasting her efforts.

223
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,389
Next, let's introduce his opponent.

224
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,771
This man's background is unknown.

225
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,566
His fighting style is unknown.

226
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:47,155
This enigmatic monster is going to
run rampant in this kengan match.

227
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,284
Standing 195 cm tall and weighing 130 kg,

228
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,370
he makes his kengan match debut today.

229
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,914
Representing Umiichi Securities,

230
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:03,171
also known as "The Crying Man,"
Masaki Meguro!

231
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,926
I'm so excited.

232
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,013
Should I break him?
Or should I strangle him?

233
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,807
Or I could tear him apart.

234
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,479
He's crying blood!

235
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:24,025
Meguro is entering the arena
with tears of blood running down his face!

236
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,527
Watch me, Father.

237
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:31,491
I'm going to kill him better
than the way I killed you.

238
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,629
-I made it.
-Where's Ohma?

239
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,547
KAEDE AKIYAMA
NOGI GROUP CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY

240
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:49,300
-He told me to not to wait for him.
-Okay.

241
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:56,432
That's the guy who attacked Mr. Sawada.
I had no idea he was a kengan fighter.

242
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,352
I'm going to kill him. Kill... Kill...

243
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,189
Kill... Kill... Kill... Kill...

244
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,071
You're breathing very heavily.
You're a psycho, aren't you?

245
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,198
Take your stance.

246
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,242
Fight!

247
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,538
That's judo.

248
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,747
Perfect.

249
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,209
M... Meguro got the mount.

250
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,296
Play with him, Masaki.

251
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,008
My father told me...

252
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,514
that judo is the strongest martial art.

253
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,391
Cut the crap.

254
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,396
Muteba's trying hard to escape the mount.

255
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,358
But it seems like his punches are less
effective because of his position.

256
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,945
Hey. Why aren't you wearing anything?

257
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,865
I can't pull my usual move on you.

258
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,578
Meguro is strangling him!

259
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,249
You can't breathe?

260
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,377
Of course you can't.

261
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,047
If you see my father on the other side,

262
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,176
tell him that I'm very grateful
to him for teaching me judo.

263
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,139
Tell him yourself.

264
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,641
He smashed his eyeball!

265
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,937
He barely flinched!

266
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,273
In that case...

267
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,986
I'll only ask you once.

268
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,449
I was hired to win, not to kill.

269
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,118
I'll let you choose.

270
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,996
Will you surrender or die?

271
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,335
Did he just gain more power?

272
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:52,506
Impossible. Does he not feel pain?

273
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,009
Damn freak.

274
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,847
Wh... what is going on here?

275
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,601
Meguro's suffered substantial injuries,

276
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,103
yet is somehow able to
continue to attack Muteba!

277
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,858
I remember.
My father told me something else.

278
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,152
His eye-for-an-eye policy was

279
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,530
two eyes for one eye!

280
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,245
Meguro gouged his eyes out.

281
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,375
Does this man not have a human heart?

282
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,959
Here you go.

283
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,093
He got his testicles.

284
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,388
That's Muteba's one brutal strike.

285
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:48,104
What are those people doing?
This is not combat sport.

286
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,147
I don't understand.

287
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,776
Is he immortal?

288
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,904
-Euphoria?
-Correct.

289
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,574
It's one of the effects
of endogenous opiates,

290
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,952
such as endorphins and dopamine.

291
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,163
In other words, it's a pleasant sensation
produced by the brain.

292
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,582
Meguro has a unique constitution

293
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,420
in which his brain secretes natural drugs
in proportion to the pain he feels.

294
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:17,425
In short, any injury he receives
is converted into pleasure.

295
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,804
Although I have made some adjustments.

296
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,101
-He's smiling. Meguro is wearing a smile!
-What's wrong? What's wrong?

297
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,645
Are you okay, Father?

298
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,440
Oh. You're suffering.

299
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,693
Okay, then. Let me finish you off.

300
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,197
Don't cry.

301
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,533
That's no use.

302
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:47,079
I can see you as well as if you were
sitting in the palm of my hand.

303
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,040
Muteba threw him away!

304
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,376
JERRY TYSON, FIGHTER, 22ND CENTURY FAX
(ELIMINATED)

305
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,336
I don't understand
what's going on here at all.

306
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,715
Didn't Muteba lose his vision?

307
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,093
How was he able to dodge Meguro's attacks
and deliver his blow?

308
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,181
The fighters have discovered his secret.

309
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,644
Muteba Gizenga,
he was blind from the start.

310
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,272
No way. That's impossible.

311
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,818
He's been watching the matches
on the monitors.

312
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,280
Are you dumb? He wasn't watching.

313
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:26,160
He was listening to the fighters'
movements through the monitor.

314
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,287
Sounds.

315
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,664
He uses echo location to detect terrain

316
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,668
and predicts the moves his opponents
will make by picking up sounds.

317
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,295
Smell.

318
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,924
He determines the number of his enemies,
their physical health and equipment

319
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,425
based on smell.

320
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,469
Finally, touch.

321
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:47,556
He fine-tunes the terrain information
he has already gathered.

322
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:53,687
In his world, he can see better than
an ordinary man.

323
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,774
How can you see?

324
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:02,822
You really are amazing... Father.

325
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,910
He's put his elbow back into its position.

326
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,247
Enough absurdity.

327
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,708
Just die, you monster!

328
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,655
You haven't trained your insides,
have you?

329
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,038
Masaki. Masaki.

330
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,415
"KEEP OUT! NO TRESPASSING"

331
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,833
Answer my question.

332
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,836
Why did you have to kill
your senior disciples?

333
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,383
Because I couldn't help it.

334
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,431
I've been holding it in for 13 years.

335
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,851
I couldn't hold myself back anymore.

336
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,649
I realized my son was not human.

337
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,571
He was just a monster
who'd been playing the role of a human...

338
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,826
called Masaki Meguro.

339
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,462
That was fun.

340
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,090
Meguro!

341
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,349
We have a winner.
The winner is Muteba Gizenga.

342
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,230
He was just a beast, after all.

343
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,732
It's not important.

344
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,068
We have one fighter...

345
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,780
actually, no, we have two fighters
moving into the second round.

346
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,493
That was horrible.

347
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,996
He delivered the death blow
without hesitation.

348
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,668
-Killing him was going too far.
-I don't think so.

349
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,088
He died because he was weak.

350
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,592
The weaker one dies. It's the natural
order of things, isn't it?

351
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,720
That's not true, Ohma.

352
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,391
Killing somebody is never a good thing.

353
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,351
As a matter of interest,

354
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,938
you haven't killed anyone, have you, Ohma?

355
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,694
There's no need for you to feel guilty.

356
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,448
I lost because I was weaker than him.

357
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,701
That's all.

358
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,204
But Ohma...

359
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,541
Don't come over...

360
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,877
to this side.

361
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,509
You wouldn't understand.

362
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,056
-Ohma?
-Sorry. I'm going to take a nap.

363
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,269
I'm a little tired.

364
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,771
Ohma.

365
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,653
Ohma Tokita.

366
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,655
Poor man.

367
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,742
He doesn't have much time left.

368
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,543
PREVIEW

369
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,002
Sumo or Pro-Wrestling?

370
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:13,507
That's the philosophical question
engraved on men's life stories.

371
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,593
Neither one of them will give an inch.

372
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,805
What do you believe in?
Next episode: "Faith"

373

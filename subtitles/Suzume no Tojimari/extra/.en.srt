00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,630
I can't do anything. Useless.

549
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,530
The key!

550
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,660
(grunts, gasps)

551
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,330
(rumbling)

552
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,030
(gasps) It's going to fall.

553
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,930
(panting)

554
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,330
I'm coming!

555
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,800
-SOUTA: Suzume?
-(yelps)

556
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,470
-You should have left!
-(straining)

557
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,100
Are you not afraid to die?

558
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm not!

559
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,470
SOUTA:
All right, then.

560
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,370
I need you to lock the door.

561
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,830
-Huh?
-Close your eyes.

562
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,700
Think of the people.
this place belonged to,

563
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,500
and the keyhole will appear.

564
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,060
SUZUME:
You're telling me now?

565
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,330
SOUTA:
You were right. I can't do it.

566
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,960
Eyes closed.

567
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,730
Feel all the emotion.
that should be here.

568
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,330
Listen to the past.

569
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,260
Hear their voices.

570
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,130
-STUDENTS: Morning.
-BOY: How's it going?

571
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,730
-Exams tomorrow.
-GIRL: Wait up. I'm coming.

572
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,030
BOY 2:
Man, it's hot.

573
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,730
BOY 3:
No way. You really told her?

574
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,430
GIRL 2:
I know. Crazy, right?

575
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,000
I couldn't believe it.

576
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,930
SOUTA: O Divine Gods.
who dwell beneath this land,

577
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,230
you have protected us,
sheltered us for generations.

578
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,930
Your mountains and rivers
we have long called our own,

579
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,930
they are not ours by right.

580
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,130
-We claim them no longer.
-(grunts)

581
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,730
-Now! I return them to you!
-(grunts, yelps)

582
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,760
(whooshing)

583
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,760
(Suzume panting softly)

584
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,730
-(Suzume sighs)
-(Souta laughing)

585
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,030
SOUTA:
We actually pulled it off.

586
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,600
Nicely done.

587
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,530
You just stopped an earthquake.

588
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,630
Huh? Uh, yeah.

589
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,130
(laughs) I really did.

590
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,030
-That was so crazy!
-(Souta laughing)

591
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,430
Hey, we make a good team,
don't we?

592
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,630
-DAIJIN: Suzume, good job.
-(gasps)

593
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,500
SUZUME:
Huh?

594
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,830
Another will open.
Hope you're ready.

595
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,230
SOUTA:
It's the Keystone.

596
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,560
Come back!

597
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,800
(both sigh)

598
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,030
Was he the one who opened it?

599
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
(insects chirping)

600
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,430
TAMAKI (voice-over):
Huh? You're in Ehime now?

601
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,930
I just... (sighs)

602
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,030
I don't know what's going on.

603
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,430
Yesterday, you told me you were
sleeping over at Aya's.

604
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,630
Hmm?

605
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,630
A little vacation?

606
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,730
If that's a joke,
it's not funny.

607
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,860
Come home tomorrow,
or you're in big trouble.

608
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,330
Okay? And don't do anything...

609
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,000
Minoru, we got a table.

610
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,800
-You go ahead. I'll catch up.
-Hmm?

611
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,830
I thought I'd invite
Tamaki with us.

612
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
I mean it! This is serious.

613
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,830
What'll you do
about your school?

614
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
(laughs)

615
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,230
Going through
a rebellious phase, huh?

616
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,230
That's enough. Just tell me
where you're staying tonight.

617
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,760
I hope it's safe, and you'd
better not be with a boy.

618
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,160
-(phone chimes)
-(gasps)

619
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,700
(sighs)

620
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,430
Yes, Minoru? Need something?

621
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,130
Oh, um, Shige got us
a table at...

622
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,630
Oh, hey, where'd he go?

623
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,960
TAMAKI:
Honestly, that girl.

624
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,560
(groaning)

625
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,930
-(sighs)
-(knocking)

626
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,030
Huh?

627
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,430
Yes?

628
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,830
I thought you might want
some dinner.

629
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,900
Oh. Wow. Thank you. (chuckles)

630
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,600
Sure thing. There's enough
for two, if you want company.

631
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,530
Sounds good. Uh, just a sec.

632
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,130
I'll be right back.

633
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,230
What do we do?

634
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,230
SOUTA:
You two go ahead.

635
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,470
Turns out chairs
don't need food.

636
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,560
I'll be fine.

637
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,730
SUZUME and CHIKA:
Let's dig in.

638
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,060
Mmm!

639
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,600
Wow, this is good.

640
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,700
Whoa, are you crying?

641
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah. It's just so good.

642
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,130
You must have been
really hungry.

643
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,000
We had a ton of customers
today, for some reason.

644
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,930
Sorry to make you wait
for so long.

645
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,060
No, don't apologize, seriously.

646
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,430
You've given me food,
clean clothes, a place to stay.

647
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,930
Hmm. Oh, geez.

648
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,160
Who is it?

649
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,730
My aunt.

650
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Ugh. Oh, she wrote a novel.

651
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,530
(gasps)

652
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,960
(groans)
I swear she'd be happier

653
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,260
if she went on a date
once in a while.

654
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,530
Is she single? How old?

655
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,800
About 40, I think.

656
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,700
She's really pretty, though.

657
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,200
It's just me and her.

658
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,630
She's been my guardian
since I was little.

659
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,730
Sounds complicated.

660
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,600
Nah, but sometimes...
I feel like I've taken

661
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,060
the best years of her life
from her, you know?

662
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,930
-Especially lately.
-(chuckling): Listen to you.

663
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,130
Sounds like you're
a guilty ex-boyfriend.

664
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,860
(gasps) You're right.

665
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,060
(laughs)

666
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,500
I wish she'd just
leave the nest already.

667
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,960
(Suzume and Chika laughing)

668
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,500
CHIKA: Speaking of
ex-boyfriends, you have any?

669
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,760
Ever date someone, I mean.

670
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,500
-Huh? No one.
-Hmm.

671
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,200
Smart girl, Suzume.

672
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,000
Boys our age are nothing
but trouble, I'm telling you.

673
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,160
Huh? So, have you had
a boyfriend before?

674
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Want to hear?

675
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,370
-No, not again!
-Absolutely not!

676
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,930
The bath could use
cleaning, too.

677
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,500
(gasps) You're kidding me!
He really did that?

678
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,130
Yep, sure did. What's more...

679
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,130
SUZUME:
No way! I can't believe it!

680
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,430
CHIKA: I know, right?
Boys are so dumb.

681
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,030
(Suzume and Chika laughing)

682
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,660
CHIKA (sighs): I haven't been
back to that place in a while.

683
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,530
It was kind of nice
seeing it again.

684
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,760
Huh?

685
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,500
The spot I drove you to earlier.

686
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,370
My middle school was there.

687
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,530
After the landslide
a few years ago,

688
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,930
they abandoned the whole area.

689
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,630
Suzume, I can't help wondering
what you were up to,

690
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,330
how you got all covered in mud.

691
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,530
And the chair--
what's with that?

692
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
I mean, what's your story?

693
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,930
-Really.
-Uh...

694
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,260
Well, that chair,
it's a memento of my mom.

695
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,060
Or it was.

696
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,860
Sorry. It's hard to explain.

697
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,600
You really are
like a wizard, you know?

698
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,760
So full of secrets.

699
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,230
And the strange thing is...

700
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,330
I get the feeling that
whatever you're doing,

701
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,500
it's super important.

702
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,760
Thank you, Chika!

703
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,160
I'm doing something big,
bigger than ever before.

704
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,330
-(Souta gasps softly)
-(Chika laughs)

705
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,060
Wow. Modest much?

706
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,500
(both laughing)

707
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
(birds chirping)

708
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,730
Why do some people have
such a hard time waking up?

709
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,370
What, your BF? What?

710
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,560
I don't have one.
I'm just saying.

711
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,000
You can go
the fairy tale route.

712
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,530
-Give him a big kiss.
-What?

713
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,100
Ah. I heard you're
headed home today.

714
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,330
That's right.

715
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,630
Thank you so much
for everything.

716
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,600
You're welcome back
anytime, dear.

717
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,300
-Thanks.
-Hey, check it out.

718
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,900
-This guy is amazing.
-Hmm?

719
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,900
REPORTER: No one knows
where this kitty came from,

720
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,600
but he seems right at home.

721
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,300
crossing the cables
of that suspension bridge.

722
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,900
His progress is being
closely followed...

723
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,800
MAN (laughs):
Would you look at that?

724
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,900
Souta, he's been sighted again.

725
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,370
Wake up already!

726
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,630
We don't have time!

727
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,500
(grunting in frustration)

728
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,130
(groans)

729
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,700
(gasps)

730
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,800
Wait. Is that right?

731
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,700
Where is your mouth?

732
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,030
SOUTA (groans):
Suzume?

733
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,600
Good morning. What's up?

734
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,200
Honestly, what do you think?

735
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,630
Daijin, obviously, but I don't
know what he's doing.

736
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,200
SOUTA: Gods follow naught
but their own whims.

737
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,700
Gods?

738
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,600
SOUTA: That bridge
he's crossing leads to Kobe.

739
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,030
-We should head there and...
-(knocking)

740
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,230
CHIKA: Suzume!
You're leaving soon, right?

741
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,530
Yep, just getting dressed.

742
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,000
Well, I'm right on time.

743
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,470
Here. I thought
these might help.

744
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,900
Huh?

745
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,430
Mm, looks better on you
than me, for sure.

746
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,960
You stick out way less.

747
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,230
with the chair hidden
and no uniform.

748
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,330
Chika, all you've done--

749
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,830
I don't know how
to pay you back.

750
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,660
No, I'll make it easy on you.

751
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,730
-Visit sometime?
-I will.

752
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,930
I promise. (sniffles)

753
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,930

754
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,530
(birds chirping)

755
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,660
-SOUTA: This isn't working.
-Hmm?

756
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,730
You need to be clearer
about what you want.

757
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,530
Wave your arms around
or something.

758
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,930
We could trade places.

759
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,730
Then people would stop
out of pure shock.

760
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,660
That would draw attention
we don't need.

761
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,060
-(chuckles) Glad you agree.
-Huh?

762
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,960
-You actually do get it.
-(chuckles)

763
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,060
(thunder crashes)

764
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,860
(whimpering)

765
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,960
SOUTA:
Why don't we just take the bus?

766
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,260
Uh, next one isn't
for six hours, though.

767
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,630
SOUTA:
Suzume.

768
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,200
Last night, you said this chair
was a memento of your mother?

769
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,830
Oh. Yeah.

770
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,370
So, what happened
to the fourth leg?

771
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,730
Well, I was so young,

772
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,800
I don't really remember
the whole story,

773
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,030
but I do remember
that I lost the chair once.

774
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,860
Then, when I found it,
a leg was gone.

775
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,500
Huh? (gasps)

776
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,530
Be a while till a bus comes.

777
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Where you headed off to, hon?

778
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,530
So, a little
soul searching, huh?

779
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,060
Sounds fun.

780
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,900
Downtown Kobe, you said?

781
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,900
-Yes, if you don't mind.
-Mm-hmm.

782
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,530
We were just on our way home.

783
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,470
from a visit
to Grandma's house.

784
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,760
And home is in Kobe,
so you lucked out.

785
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,470
Mom, look at this.

786
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,660
-It's a chair.
-Weird.

787
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,030
Hey! Ah-ah!

788
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,430
No messing with
the nice girl's stuff!

789
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,930
-You got it?
-KIDS: 'Kay.

790
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,470
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine, really.

00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,060
(kids grunt)

792
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
They're staring...
What's got them so interested?

793
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,370
That's strange.

794
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,430
Uh, it's nothing that special.
Just a little chair.

795
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah, that it?

796
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,860
They're still staring.

Hmm, didn't know you could see

807
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,200
the amusement park from here.

808
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,630
Barely, but still.

809
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,530
Huh? An amusement park? Where?

810
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,160
There, up over that mountain.

811
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,600
(sighs) My folks took me a lot
back when I was little.

812
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,200
But things went downhill
and it closed.

813
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,600
Now they don't even have

814
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,000
the money to tear
the place down.

815
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,600
There's lots of lonely places
like that these days.

You have got to be kidding.

Running away from home?

I mean, I did that
when I was a kid, too.

870
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,300
It's a teen thing, you know?

871
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,930
High school, parental pressure,

872
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,400
all of that starts to feel
suffocating after a while.

873
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,770
This one time, I...

874
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,630
We're not talking about you
right now.

875
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,200
Ah. Sorry.

876
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,630
(sighs) I don't know.

877
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,370
What am I doing wrong?
She keeps putting me off.

878
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,970
Won't even tell me
where she's staying tonight.

879
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,800
I have no idea where she is.

880
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,930
Uh, can't you track her
by her phone's GPS?

881
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,300
Don't have that.

882
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,800
So that's out.
We just have to keep thinking.

883
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,030
What about her bank account?
You have access to that?

884
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,500
Huh?

885
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,700
Any luck finding her?

886
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,600
Yeah, I did. She's in Kobe.

887
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,000
Kobe, huh?

888
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,800
Geez, that's a long way
from home.

889
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,600
I can't let her
stay out there all alone.

890
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,030
Um, you know,
if there's anything else.

891
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,170
I can do to help,
just say the word, and I...

892
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,530
Minoru, listen.

893
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,400
I'm taking
the day off tomorrow.

894
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,800
Oh?

895
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,330
Then I guess I am, too.

896
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,800
What for? You need to work
tomorrow, don't you?

897
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,300
MINORU (chuckles):

What's wrong?

1076
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,700
-I was so terrified out there.
-Huh?

1077
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,030
(Souta laughs)

1078
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,330
SOUTA:
You were amazing out there.

1079
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,870
Thank you.

1080
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
(creaking)

1081
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,430
I'm curious.

1082
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,570
What were you looking at
beyond the Gate?

1083
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,070
SUZUME:
Huh? Oh.

1084
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,930
A night sky
lit up by millions of stars,

1085
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,270
and a big field.

1086
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,730
-The Ever-After.
-Huh?

1087
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,930
So, you can actually see it?

1088
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,170
What is that?

1089
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,670
This world's other half,
where the worm dwells.

1090
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,100
There, all time exists
simultaneously.

1091
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,200
I could see it,
but I couldn't go in.

1092
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:57,300
SOUTA: The Ever-After is where
our souls go to rest.

1093
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,700
It's not somewhere
that the living can reach.

1094
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,600
Not a place
we're supposed to go.

1095
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,870
(door opens, bell jingles)

1096
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,730
Looks like
the troublemaker's back.

1097
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,600
(gasps) Where were you?

1098
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,300
I was so worried.

1099
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,800
Oh. I'm sorry. I, uh...

1100
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,570
Running off
at this time of night?

1101
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,900
What were you thinking?

1102
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,530
Well, she's all right,
isn't she?

1103
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,070
That's not the point.

1104
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,400
MIKI: And we ran away from home
how many times?

1105
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,900
-(stomach gurgles)
-(grunts)

1106
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,400
(chuckles)

1107
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,030
Lecture over.
Let's grab a bite, okay?

1108
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,400
I'm sorry.

1109
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,500
MIKI:
How about some fried udon?

1110
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,230
RUMI: Yeah, with
a sunny-side-up egg?

1111
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,400
-MIKI: And tuna mayo, too.
-RUMI: Mmm. Suzume?

1112
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,830
SUZUME: Well, at home,
we put potato salad on top.

1113
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,200
-SOUTA: Huh?
-MIKI: On fried udon?

1114
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,530
(sizzling)

1115
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,500
Uh, I don't know about that.

1116
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,000
(Rumi laughs)

1117
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,600
-The calorie count alone.
-I'm so hungry.

1118
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,700
RUMI and MIKI:
Time to eat.

1119
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,000
Mmm.

1120
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,200
It's so good.

1121
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,900
-Thank you.
-Not diet food, though.

1122
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,770
-MIKI: This calls for a beer.
-(Suzume gasps)

1123
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,370
MIKI:
You in?

1124
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,170
RUMI: You want a beer now?
After drinking all night?

1125
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,830
-MIKI: Sure. Why not?
-You should join us, Souta.

1126
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,130
RUMI: This potato salad's
really good.

1127
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,670
SOUTA:
Hey. Suzume, what are you...

1128
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,000
MIKI: I'm making this.
for my boyfriend.

1129
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,400
RUMI:
When'd you get a boyfriend?

1130
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:09,600
MIKI:
Won't be long now.

1131
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,330
What's with the chair?

1132
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,330
It's kid-sized. Adorable.

1133
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,570
Why do you have it?

1134
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,000
Uh, to remember Kobe.

1135
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,600
-That makes no sense.
-(laughter)

1136
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,700
(camera clicks)

1137
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,230
SOUTA (chuckles):
They must have thought

1138
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,400
you were really weird.

1139
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,630
SUZUME:
Probably.

1140
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,870
So, is it always
like this for you,

1141
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,600
going from place to place?

1142
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:33,970
SOUTA: Not always.
I have a flat in Tokyo.

1143
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,800
And I plan to be a teacher
once I'm done with grad school.

1144
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,730
-Huh?
-SOUTA: Huh?

1145
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,600
-Huh? You're in grad school?
-Well, yeah.

1146
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,000
You can't be a teacher.
You're a Closer.

1147
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,130
Being a Closer has been
in my family for generations.

1148
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,000
I'll continue that.

1149
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,530
But it doesn't put food
on the table.

1150
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,970
I guess not.

1151
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,800
It's such an important job,
though.

1152
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,800
SOUTA:
A lot of times, important jobs

1153
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,430
are ones people shouldn't see.

1154
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,800
I need to get back
into my own body,

1155
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,730
or I'm not gonna be very good
at either of mine.

1156
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,070
(breathing deeply)

1157
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,170
SOUTA (voice-over):
But can I?

1158
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,270
It's like I'm
right at the edge,

1159
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,570
about to fall.

1160
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,670
It's all getting farther.

1161
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,770
The light grows dimmer.

1162
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,030
The voices grow fainter.

1163
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,570
My body gone.

1164
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,000
My mind fractured.

1165
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,270
(shuddering):
It's so cold.

1166
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,600
So, so cold.

1167
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,170
Where am I?

1168
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,000
-(chair creaking)
-(grunts, sighs)

1169
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,000
-(clinking)
-(gasps)

1170
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,470
Is this it, then?

1171
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,800
Is this where I end?

1172
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,200
SUZUME (faint, echoing):
Souta...

1173
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,900
(louder):
Souta!

1174
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,170
SOUTA (grunts):
Good morning.

1175
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,600
It took you long enough.

1176
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:40,900
Here, look at this.

1177
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,800
There's another photo
of Daijin.

1178
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,670
See?

1179
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,630
-Suzume.
-Huh?

1180
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,270
Did you do something to me?

1181
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,900
Like what?

1182
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,870
And I thought you'd be helping.
out at the bar again tonight.

1183
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,600
-I'm disappointed. (chuckles)
-(gasps)

1184
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,200
Here, this is for you.

1185
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,700
Oh, yeah.

1186
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:05,000
You look even more like
a little runaway now.

1187
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,530
Thank you for the hat,
and for everything.

1188
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,400
-Truly.
-(chuckles)

1189
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,270
RUMI: Just be sure to send word
to your guardian, all right?

1190
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,430
SUZUME:
Okay.

1191
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,600
(voice-over):
Ah, crap!

1192
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,800
I totally forgot about Tamaki.

1193
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,000
55 texts?

1194
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,830
Wait, she's coming to get me?
(whimpers)

1195
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,800
SOUTA: Suzume,
you can make the next train.

1196
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,800
Buy a ticket. Hurry.

1197
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:26,000
SUZUME:
The bullet train? You sure?

1198
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,800
SOUTA: We know where Daijin is,
and this is the quickest way.

1199
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,500
So why not take it?

1200
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,200
SUZUME:
To Tokyo, though?

1201
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,000
That'll eat up all my savings.

1202
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,770
You better pay me back,
Mr. College Man.

1203
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,600
SOUTA:
I got you covered.

1204
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,530
SUZUME:
Souta, you have to see this.

1205
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,930
SOUTA:
What is it?

1206
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,000
SUZUME: Look, we're going
so fast right now.

1207
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,000
This train rules.

1208
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,470
SOUTA:
Yeah, it's the best.

1209
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,900
ANNOUNCER:
Attention, please.

1210
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,970
We will soon arrive at Atami.
The doors...

1211
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,470
SUZUME:
Oh, no. Souta.

1212
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,670
-SOUTA: What's wrong?
-This is awful.

1213
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,070
We totally just missed
Mount Fuji.

1214
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,330
There, see?

1215
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,630
You didn't think maybe
you should say something?

1216
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,670
SOUTA (chuckles):
I guess not.

1217
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,900
I'm sad now.

1218
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,070
Sorry.

1219
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,870
ANNOUNCER:
Attention, please.

1220
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,670
We will soon arrive at Tokyo.

1221
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,170
(door chimes)

1222
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,070
ANNOUNCER 2: Thank you
for traveling to Tokyo.

1223
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,270
-This is the final stop...
-(Suzume gasps)

1224
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,570
SOUTA:
Suzume, that way.

1225
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,470
-SUZUME: Okay.
-SOUTA: Right. Left.

1226
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,870
-(Suzume whimpers)
-SOUTA: Go up.

1227
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,530
Train on the left. Run.

1228
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,070
-Faster.
-SUZUME: Aah!

1229
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,670
(door chiming)

1230
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,270
-(sighs, gasps)
-SOUTA: Time to get off.

1231
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,600
(beeps)

1232
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,370
(sighs)

1233
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,530
Could you treat me
a little less like a horse?

1234
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,230
SOUTA:
Before we look for Daijin,

1235
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,800
there's a stop I want to make.

1236
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,530
Could you call someone for me?

1237
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:40,930
(groans)

1238
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,700
(children laughing,
chatting playfully)

1239
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,470
(door chimes)

1240
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,170
WOMAN:
Hello. Welcome.

1241
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,570
Uh...

1242
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,330
Uh, um, hello.

1243
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,370
My name is Iwato.

1244
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,770
I called earlier, and, well...

1245

-WOMAN 2: Oh, yes, of course.

1246
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,770
You're related to Souta, right?

1247
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,570
Been expecting you.

1248
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,170
Here's the key to his place.

1249
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,200
Up the stairs, room 301.

1250
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,230
Take your time.

1251
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,600
You've got quite the fan club
around here,

1252
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,200
-don't you?
-SOUTA: Huh?

1253
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,700
How is he? When's he going
to get back from his trip?

1254
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,700
It's a bit lonely without him.

1255
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,470
He's such a sweetheart
and so cute.

1256

gorgeous. (chuckles)

1262

SOUTA:
I want to look something up.

1263
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,370
On the top shelf,
see that cardboard box?

1264
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,830
Grab it for me.

1265
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,370
SUZUME:
Sure.

1266
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,700

(gasps excitedly)

1270
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,830
You don't mind, do you, Souta?
(laughs)

1271
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,870
SOUTA:
A little late to ask that.

1272
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,270
Oh, wow. Is this it-- the worm?

1273
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,370
SOUTA:
Yeah.

1274
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,170
And it also shows
the Keystones.

1275
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,170
The Western Pillar
and the Eastern Pillar.

1276
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,470
Wait. Keystones?

1277
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,100
SOUTA:
There are two.

1278
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,470
Disasters that couldn't be
contained by closing the Gate

1279
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,870
were sealed away
using the Keystones.

1280
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,670
So the locations change
from era to era.

1281
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,030
The Keystone from Kyushu
changed forms

1282
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,900
and is running around
as Daijin.

1283
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,570
-Oh.
-The Eastern Pillar is here,

1284
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,970
in Tokyo,
keeping the worm's head at bay.

1285
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,100
(gasps)

1286
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,170
What I don't know
is its exact location.

1287
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,130
And we need to find that out.
because, apparently

1288
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:05,000
there's a huge Gate there
as well: Tokyo's Gate.

1289
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:08,270
It opened a hundred years ago
and decimated the Kanto region

1290
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,770
before finally being shut
by the Closers of that time.

1291
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,970
My guess is that Daijin
is trying to reopen that door.

1292
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,200
So much for that.

1293
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,770
Looks like the information
we need has been blotted out.

1294
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,930
SUZUME:
Why? Is the location a secret?

1295
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:32,400
SOUTA: I'll have to
ask Grandpa about it.

1296
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:33,600
SUZUME:
Your grandpa?

1297
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,200
SOUTA:
He pretty much raised me.

1298
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,400
He's in a hospital nearby.

1299
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,530
I didn't want him
to see me like this.

1300
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,830
He'll be disappointed.

Get him to leave.

1307
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,170
SERIZAWA:
All right, dude, I'm coming in.

1308
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,670
That's all the warning
you're gonna get.

He's not a bad guy, really.

1310
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:00,930
Huh?

1311
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,130
Hi there.

1312
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:04,200
Um, you're not Souta.

1313
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,670
No, his sister.

1314
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,230
He's got a sister? Since when?

1315
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,130
I'm more of a cousin
who's like a sister, you know?

1316
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,170
-Huh?
-So, um,

1317
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,400
you're his friend, right?

1318
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,800
Serizawa?

1319
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,000
Teacher employment exam?

1320
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,100
SERIZAWA: Yeah.
Yesterday was the second one,

1321
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,400
but he was a total no-show,
the idiot.

1322
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,000
He had a test yesterday?

1323
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:26,930
SERIZAWA: I don't know
what he was thinking.

1324
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,600
That's four years of work
down the drain.

1325
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,400
And it bothered me so much,

1326
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,170
I couldn't focus
on my own test.

1327
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,770
And then you show up.
Suzume, yeah?

1328

When you get a hold
of that loser,

1329
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,370
I want you to tell him
that I'm pissed,

1330
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,730
and he is dead to me.

1331
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,830
No, wait,
he owes me 20,000 yen.

1332
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,470
Money first,
and then we are done.

1333
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,970
I heard his family business
was in trouble and all,

1334
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,130
but still, that guy's got a
life of his own to worry about.

01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:14,030
I don't ever want
to see you again.

1597
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,100
Suzume doesn't love me.

1598
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,670
(wind whistling)

1599
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,070
(heavy creaking)

1600
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,070
I'll come back for you.
I promise.

1601
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:38,000
I return them to you.

1602
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,200
(shuddering breaths)

1603
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,600
-(indistinct radio broadcast)
-DRIVER: Huh?

1604
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,630
(panting)

1605
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:19,200
(sighs)

1606
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,500
GIRL (voice-over): Hey,
look at that girl over there.

1607
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,100
She's not wearing any shoes.

1608
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,600
You're right. Crazy.

1609
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,630
(beeps)

1610
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,500
MAN: Look at her clothes.
Wonder what happened.

1611
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,670
MAN 2:
Oh, she's barefoot, too.

1612
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,700
MAN 1:
For real?

1613
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,300
(horn honking)

1614
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:40,100
I'm glad Munakata's condition
has stabilized.

1615
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:43,300
Me, too. Things looked
pretty grim yesterday.

1616
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:44,900
SUZUME:
Souta's grandpa.

1617
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:47,230
(medical monitor beeping
steadily)

1618
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:56,200
(shudders)

1619
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:01,500
As I feared,
Souta failed, didn't he?

1620
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,930
I shouldn't have barged in.
I'm sorry.

1621
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:07,600
Souta told me you were in
a hospital nearby, and, well...

1622
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,370
(sighs)

1623
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,870
Reckless boy.

1624
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,700
Did he drag you into this?

1625
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:18,170
Tell me, then,
what is my grandson's fate?

1626
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,600
He's in the Ever-After,
as a Keystone.

1627
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:24,100
Then he's gone.

1628
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:27,130
I saw the worm appear
from my window yesterday

1629
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,100
and cover the city.

1630
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,770
I wanted nothing more
than to go myself,

1631
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,200
but of course I couldn't.

1632
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,270
This broken body of mine
wouldn't cooperate.

1633
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,900
Sir, can you help me?

1634
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:40,770
I want to know how
to enter the Ever-After.

1635
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,500
Why is that?

1636
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,930
Because I have to go
save Souta.

1637
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,300
-Foolish and unnecessary.
-Huh?

1638
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:52,270
Souta will spend decades
as a Keystone housing the gods.

1639
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,770
You cannot alter his fate,
nor should you attempt to.

1640
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,300
Accept that he is no longer
of the mortal realm.

1641
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,800
and let him go.

1642
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:02,100
How can you... No, please,
there must be a way.

1643
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:07,500
Let him go, or do you wish to
waste my grandson's sacrifice?

1644
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:09,570
Who pierced the worm
and sealed it away?

1645
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,900
Well, I...

1646
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,700
Was it you using
Souta's Keystone form?

1647
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,100
-But it was all so...
-Answer me, girl!

1648
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,100
I did it!

1649
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,730
Okay.

1650
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:20,270
You did what you had to
to prevent millions of deaths,

1651
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,600
so take pride in your deed
and leave it.

1652
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:24,030
I absolve you of blame,

1653
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,930
if that's what
you're waiting for.

1654
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,300
Go back to your life
and say nothing.

1655
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,630
(gasping breaths)

1656
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:37,330
Ordinary people have no place
in our world.

1657
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:39,330
Forget it all.

1658
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:41,700
You'll be better off that way.

1659
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:44,930
I could never forget. Never.

1660
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:46,900
I'll open
the underground Gate again.

1661
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,300
Impossible.

1662
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,700
No, you can't.

1663
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,300
There's a way,
and I'll find it.

1664
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:54,570
There isn't, and even if
there were, it wouldn't matter.

1665
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,300
The Gate must remain closed.
Come back!

1666
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:00,000
(coughing)

1667
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,700
(coughing stops)

1668
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:07,600
(labored breathing)

1669
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,500
The Ever-After is beautiful,
but it's the realm of the dead.

1670
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,500
That much at least
should frighten you.

1671
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,100
Maybe, but it doesn't.

1672
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:22,300
If one lives or dies,
it's all a matter of luck.

1673
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:24,100
I've always felt that way.

1674
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:25,400
But...

1675
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:29,370
(crying): ...a world
without Souta terrifies me.

1676
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,430
Huh?

1677
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,800
(laughing)

1678
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,900
Very well.
There is one Gate alone.

1679
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:43,230
through which a person
may pass in their lifetime.

1680
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:46,600
You've been to the Ever-After
before, haven't you?

1681
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:49,470
What did you see there?

1682
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,370
Looked like...

1683
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,400
a younger version of myself.

1684
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:55,000
And my mom.

1685
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:57,100
She's dead.

1686
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,530
Interesting.

1687
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,570
I suspect you perceive
the world as we do

1688
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,300
because you got lost
in the Ever-After

1689
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,200
-when you were young.
-(gasps)

1690
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:11,730
To get back there,
you must find the Gate

1691
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,600
you passed through as a child.

1692
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:15,630
(Suzume sighs)

1693
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:22,630
(labored breathing)

1694
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,730
It's been quite a while,
hasn't it?

1695
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:30,930
I see that you are
finally unbound.

1696
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:32,930
(chuckling)

1697
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:35,930
You wish to follow the girl,
don't you, old friend?

1698
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:40,030
I entrust everything to you.

1699

Hope you don't mind, Souta.

01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,770
I'll bring them back.

SERIZAWA:
Hey. Hey, you. Hello?

1707
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,200
Suzume!

1708
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,470
Huh?

1709
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,230
Serizawa?

1710
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,470
Where are you going?

1711
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,670
To find Souta?

1712
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,670
I have to find a door first.

1713
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,800
-Huh?
-Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

1714
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,570
Wait. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1715
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,870
(groans) Let go.

1716
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,130
The cousin thing's a lie,
am I right?

1717
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:56,470
-Why does it matter?
-Get in the car.

1718
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,970
-What?
-You're going after Souta,

1719
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,700
and I'm gonna help you
track him down.

1720
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,000
Why would you do that?

1721
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,670
I'm worried
about my friend, okay?

1722
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,500
-Wow, man.
-Big fight.

1723
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,530
There you are! Suzume! (grunts)

1724
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,370
(gasps) Tamaki?

1725
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,800
Oh, I've finally found you.

1726
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,730
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

1727
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:15,130
And you, stay away from her

1728
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,330
-or I'll call the police.
-Wha... Who is...

1729
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,070
Is this the guy you had over?

1730
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,770
You can't trust
a single word he says.

1731
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,730
-Huh?
-We're going.

1732
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:24,670
I'm sorry, but I can't yet.

1734
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
-Serizawa, let's go.
-Right.

1735
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,370
You're not going anywhere
without me!

1736
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,730
(grunting)

1737
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:34,200
What the heck is wrong
with you, lady?

1738

-Move over! I'm trying...
-Hey! Watch the seat.

1739

I am not letting you drive off

SUZUME:
I can handle this, Tamaki!

1741
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,530
-Some kind of love triangle?
-Men are such pigs.

1742
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,930
Why won't you talk to me, huh?

1743
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,530
Hey, let's all take
a deep breath, yeah?

1744
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,630
Hey. You done?

01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,370
Uh, Daijin?

1746
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,800
BOTH:
Did that cat just talk?

1747
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,230
What? No, of course not.

1748
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,930
-Yeah, there's no way.
-Yeah, you're right.

1749
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:56,600
-That's crazy. (chuckles)
-I mean, a talking cat?

1750
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:58,130
-'Cause cats don't talk.
-That's nuts.

1751
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:59,730
Can we focus now?

1752
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,200

Destination confirmed.

SERIZAWA:
Whoa, geez. That's far.

1755
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,900
Hold on. Isn't that...

1756
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:09,530
You both insisted
on coming with me.

1757
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:12,900
So, please, no more arguing.

1758
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,230
SERIZAWA:
Seriously?

1759
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:22,230
Guess we won't be
making it back this evening.

01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,530
What? This is the perfect
road trip song.

1768
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:09,670
I bet the cat likes it.

1769
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,530
Well, Suzume is sleeping.

1770
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,270
We should let her rest.

1771
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,130
About our furry passenger--
a pet of hers?

1772
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:18,530
It's not ours.
We don't have a cat.

1773
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:20,330
So, according to this...
(gasps)

1774
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,730
You're a teacher in training?

1775
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,730
Yeah.
That's the idea, at least.

1776
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:27,030
-(engine revving)
-(Tamaki gasping)

1777
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,900
Not exactly the smoothest ride,
is it?

1778
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:31,170
The car's used. I'm not gonna
complain about it.

1779
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,530
Got it way cheap.

1780
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,970
Listen, are you sure
about this?

1781
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,530
It'll take more than seven
hours just to get there.

1782
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:39,570
It's not just your daughter.

1783
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,630
I'm looking for Souta, too.

1784
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,330
She's not my daughter.

1785
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:46,470
She's my niece-- sister's kid.

1786
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,730
I took Suzume
after she passed away.

1787
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,530
-She was a single mom.
-Uh...

1788
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:55,070
TAMAKI: Suzume was only four
years old when it happened.

1789
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,330
She couldn't process her mother
suddenly not being there,

1790
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:01,670
so she went out looking for her
and got lost.

1791
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,930
(voice-over):
Suzume! Suzume, where are you?

1792
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:06,330
Suzume!

1793
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:08,130
(wind whistling)

1794
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,230
(gasps)

1795
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,170
-Huh? Auntie?
-It's all right.

1796
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,600
(crying):
I'm here now.

1797
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,730
I'm sorry it took me so long
to find you.

1798
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:20,030
Starting today,
you're my daughter.

1799
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,400
12 years now. Crazy.

1800
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,930
I took her to Kyushu,

1801
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:28,130
and we've lived there together
ever since.

1802
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,630
Huh?

1803
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:32,530
Huh?

1804
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,170
Oh, sorry. Do you mind?

1805
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,330
Well, it is your car, right?

1806
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:41,300
SERIZAWA: So, we're headed
for Suzume's hometown.

1807
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:43,100
Is Souta really gonna be there?

1808
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:45,970
TAMAKI: No clue.
Don't know why he would be.

1809
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,200
It's deserted.

1810
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:50,130
You know, you could just
give up and turn back.

1811
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:52,130
Surely, she'd let it go.

1812
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:56,170
No can do. Souta owes me money,
and I need to collect.

1813
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,530
(Tamaki groans)

1814
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,000
TAMAKI:
Great. So we're getting a lift

1815
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:01,070
-from a loan shark.
-(Serizawa laughs)

1816

1821
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:33,230
Feel that--
the shaking just now?

1822
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:34,830
Ah, look who's awake.

1823
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,930
Your aunt is totally out,
though.

1824
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,630
Do you guys always sleep
in shifts?

1825
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:44,030
-You're right. I didn't notice.
-SUZUME: Stop the car.

1826

SERIZAWA:
Huh? Hey.

1828
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,970
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

1829
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,530
Suzume.

1830
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:56,230

1833
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:14,700
It's not appearing.

1834
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:18,030
Souta must be containing
the worm.

1835
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,200
Huh?

1836
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:20,800
Daijin.

1837
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:23,500
Tell me what's going on here.

1838
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:26,270
Why won't you say anything?

1839
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:30,400

can anyone do it?

1840
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:33,130
Or only Closers?

1841
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,600
SERIZAWA:
Hey. What's the deal?

1842
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,430
What did you go
running off on us for?

1843
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,470
I'm so sorry. It was nothing.

1844
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,270
Uh, we should go back now.

1845
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,700

1846
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:49,600

SERIZAWA:
Not a bad view.

1850
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:07,770
Has this area always been
so beautiful?

1851
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,900
Huh? This place is beautiful?

1852
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,530
What?

1853
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,230
Uh, are you done?

1854
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:20,100
We need to get going.

1855
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:28,330
Huh?

1856
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,630
Hey, kitty cat.

1857
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:32,100
Hear me? Hey.

1858
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:34,000
Okay, fine.

1859
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:36,530
You're as weird
as the other two.

It's raining.

1868
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,670
Uh, crap.

1869
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,530
That's not awesome.

1870
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:16,100
I don't see what
the problem is.

1871
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,870
You can just close the roof,
can't you?

1872

Yep, still broken all right.

It's not funny.

1878
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:45,130
We can't keep driving
like this.

You're with some shady playboy?

TAMAKI:
I don't know.

1889
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:10,930
I'd say he's actually
more like a discount hustler.

1890
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:13,730

get anything out of us, really.

I still don't like it.

Just him
and the two of you together,

1893
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:19,600
shut up in a car like that?

1894
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,400
It's a convertible,
if that helps.

1895
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:22,730
That's even worse!

01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:24,530

are you now?

give up, does he?

Good. Give me a sec.

1900
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:31,170
There.
I think I found something.

that shaking?

01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:07,900
There are so many
earthquakes lately.

1914
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:12,000

don't want something to eat?

I'm here, if there are things.

1917
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,200
-you want to talk about.
-Like what?

1918
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:25,930
Maybe what we're going
all this way for.

1919
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,530
A door.

1920
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:29,570
Sorry. I can't explain it.

1921
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,370
Then try harder.

1922
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,900
You owe me that after
the trouble you've caused.

1923
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:35,270
Owe you?

1924
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,670
It's not like you would
understand, so why bother?

1925
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,000
(car door opens)

1926
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:41,930
That's it.
We're taking the bus home.

1927
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,830
I don't know what else to do.
You won't tell me anything.

1928
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,800
You look depressed.
You're not eating.

1929
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:47,500
-Get off me!
-I've had it!

1930
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:48,930
You go home, then!

1931
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,730
I never asked you
to come after me!

1932
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,870
You were gone for days.

1933
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Do you have any idea
how worried I was?

1934
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:58,030
That's exactly why
I'm suffocating!

1935
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:04,270
(deep, shuddering breaths)

1936
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:10,870
Fine. I'm done.
I can't do this.

1937
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,270
I took you in
because you needed a home,

1938
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,500
then spent all of these years
caring for you.

1939
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:19,000
What an idiot, right?

1940
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:20,300
(gasps)

1941
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:23,570
Now I walk on eggshells
around you every day.

1942
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,100
The guardian
of a motherless child.

1943
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,470
With you, I could never have
a life of my own.

1944
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,370
Who would want to marry me?

1945
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,800
Too much baggage.

1946
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:32,070
Even with my sister's money,

1947
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,600
there's no balancing
that scale.

1948
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:38,140
That's how you feel?

1949
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:41,070
I know it's been hard, but...

1950
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,870
TAMAKI: I'm sorry it took me
so long to find you.

1951
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,940
It's not like
I had a choice, either.

1952
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:46,970
TAMAKI:
You're my daughter.

1953
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,140
You said I was your daughter!

1954
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,600
Nobody made you do it!

1955
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,570
-I don't remember that.
-(gasps)

1956
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,940
When we get back,
I want you out.

1957
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:57,200
Give me back
what's left of my life!

1958
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,170
(hisses)

1959
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,900
(growling)

1960
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:04,270
It's not her. Who...

1961
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:07,100
-Sadaijin.
-(thunder crashes)

1962
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,900
SUZUME:
Sadaijin?

1963
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,270
(yowling)

1964
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,670
(gasps) Oh, no! Tamaki!

1965
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,100
(cats yowling, growling)

1966
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,070
(grunting)

1967
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,530
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1968
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,530
(meows)

1969
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,240
(Tamaki grunts)

1970
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:42,530
Tamaki! Are you okay?

1971
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:44,300
What did...

1972
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,970
Sorry. I can't. I have to go.

1973
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:48,870
(crying)

1974
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,340
(cartoony music paying)

1975
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:52,870
-TAMAKI: Serizawa.
-Yeah?

1976
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,270
I think I might be
losing my mind.

1977
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,370
Huh?

1978
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,700
I have to be.

1979
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,570
I never would've said
those things.

1980
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,300
-(crying)
-(stammers) Hey.

1981
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,670
-I... Take a breath.
-(others murmuring)

1982
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,740
What happened?

1983
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:08,500
Are you okay? Aah!

1984
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:11,500
Uh... (sighs)

1985
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:13,440
Seriously?

1986
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:16,200
("Sotsugyou" by Yuki Saito
playing)

1987
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,970

Nope. Gonna pass.

01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:37,400
(chuckles) You got to admit,
when it's sunny,

1993
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,670
this car's not bad.

1994
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,270
The music is too loud.

1995
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,670
What? But I'm picking songs
that suit my audience.

1996
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,240
Hey, Suzume,
you like oldies, don't you?

1997
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,370
Guess the rain isn't done yet.

-Right, newcomer?
-(purring)

1999
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,370
Weird, us ending up
with another stray.

2000
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,740
(chuckles) And one that huge.

2001
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:59,530
Hey, look, a rainbow.

2002
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,670
How's that for a good sign?

2003
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,140
Man, sure is
a tough crowd today.

2004
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,700
Listen, Suzume,

2005
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,300
cats don't follow people
around for no reason.

2006
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,770
Not like dogs.

2007
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,600
-Hmm?
-I don't know what it is,

2008
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:19,500
but if they're here,
there must be

2009
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,370
something they want from you.

2010
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
-SADAIJIN: Precisely.
-What?

2011
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:27,170
With human hands,
return what was lost.

2012
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,070
-Uh, huh?
-Huh?

2013
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,100
-BOTH: Did that cat just talk?
-(horn blaring)

-Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

-Here we go!

Not cool.

2021
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,040
TAMAKI: Could've been
a lot worse, actually.

2022
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:02,170
So, um, it did talk before--
the cat?

2023
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,840
Yeah, I think...
No, it did, for sure.

2024
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:07,940
Is something supernatural
going on?

2025
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:10,040
TAMAKI:
No, that can't be possible.

2026
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:12,000
Excuse me!

2027
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,240
No one's stopping.

2028
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,630
Hey, Serizawa!

2029
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,940
We're about
ten kilometers out, right?

2030

VOICE (over speaker):
Approximately 20 kilometers

2031

to your destination.

2032
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,140
It's more like twice that.
It's still a decent ways away.

2033

VOICE (over speaker):
Return to the designated route.

2034
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,740
-Yeah, I know!
-All right, I'm going.

2035
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:29,570
-Huh?
-I'll run the rest of it.

2036
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:32,040
Thank you both for everything.

2037
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,200
-(Tamaki gasping, grunting)
-Uh...

2038
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,140
Huh?

01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:45,240
-Sorry, but I'm going, too.
-Huh?

2041
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:46,900
Thanks for getting us this far.

2042
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,630
-What?
-We almost made it.

2043
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:51,000
And for what it's worth,

2044
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,600
I think you're going to make
a great teacher.

01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,100
I give up.

2056
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:32,040
All this, it's you chasing
someone you love, right?

2057
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:34,200
(gasps) Uh, um, no.

2058

Who are these guys?

Um, they're supposed
to be gods, I think.

Listen, that stuff I said
in the parking lot...

2066
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,530
It's true I've felt that way
sometimes,

2067

but that's not all I've felt.

2068
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:01,800
And I've definitely never
meant to hurt you.

Same here.

2070
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:07,570

It's incredible how much
she's grown up, huh, sis?

2078

That's right,
the moon was full.

Over there,
by that big telephone pole.

2107
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:16,470
You mean this door
is the reason we're here?

2108

I'm sure she's been
looking for me, too,

2303
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,040
and she's got to be
super worried.

2304

I have to find her,
but I don't know how.

-Slow down, Suzume.

2306

She works at the hospital
making people feel better.

2311

So Mommy...
she doesn't know where to look.

2312
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,700
I'm sure that's why
she hasn't found me yet.

So don't worry, okay?

The future's not that scary.

2339
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:21,270
There will be so many people
in your life who will love you,

2340
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:25,500
and you'll even fall in love
with someone yourself one day.

the morning will come again.

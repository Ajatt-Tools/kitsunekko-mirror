the baseball club at his alma mater.➡

151
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:16,335
Their son,  Ken,  also loves baseball.➡

152
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:20,540
George,  who was into Japanese culture
and baseball, ➡

153
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,212
moved to Kyoto
and began coaching Momotaro's team.➡

154
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:31,984
Ten years later,  Momotaro finally took
Ken and Curious George, ➡

155
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,287
in their Kijima uniforms, ➡

156
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:39,492
to their first National
Baseball Championship at Koshien.➡

00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:44,163
Well,  that's all for today. Bye！>

(ｳｨﾘｱﾑ)Ms.Otsuki？

170
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,850
Oh,  Mr.Lawrence. What a coincidence.
(ｳｨﾘｱﾑ)Isn't it.

171
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,320
You know,  the last lesson
of the year was broadcast➡

172
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,255
this morning.
Yeah,  time flies.

173
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:21,527
I was relieved to hear the program is
continuing next year.

174
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,563
That's natural.

175
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:26,332
The text you wrote is brilliant.

176
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,701
Well….
It's true.

177
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:32,271
A family story
that spans one hundred years.

178
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,340
How's your mother now？

179
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,643
She seems very happy.

180
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:41,643
(錠一郎)あ…｡
もう…｡ もう…！

181
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,486
(錠一郎)う～ん… うわっ｡

182
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:49,822
Oh,  what about your grandma？

183
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,757
My grandma➡

184
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:55,628
just turned one hundred years old
last week.

185
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:59,165
(ｳｨﾘｱﾑ)Oh,  that's amazing.

186
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:01,167
What brought you here today？

187
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:06,505
I just stopped by. I stayed in Kyoto
for several weeks when I was a boy.

188
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:09,842
Oh,  did you？
Yeah,  with my uncle.

189
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:12,511
It's very nostalgic being here.

190
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,447
(物が落ちる音)

191
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:17,683
Mr.Lawrence. You dropped something.

192
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,883
Oh. Thank you.

193
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:26,554
落ちましたよ｡
(ﾋﾞﾘｰ)Oh！ Thank you！

194
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,528
It's a treasure from my childhood.

195
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:37,269
Mr.Lawrence,  you….

196
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:40,973
You can call me Billy,  if you want.

197
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:47,146
アハッ… ハハハッ｡

198
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:51,651
Billy.
Yes？

199
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:55,521
Why don't you come over to my place？

200
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:59,525
Let's enjoy kaiten-yaki together.

201
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,825
Why not.

202
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:08,000
May I call you Hinata？

203
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,871
Of course！
Okay.

204
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,774
<And,  this is the very end➡

205
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:21,474

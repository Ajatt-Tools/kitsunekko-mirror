1
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,264
Dongsuk.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,516
Why do we make it so complicated?

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,643
We can just kill them there.

4
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,396
Are you an idiot?

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:25,150
If we do it there and wake up that spider, how will we take the mana crystal?

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,570
I don't care what his nickname is.

7
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,281
An E-Rank hunter and a D-Rank hunter without combat experience

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,074
will never defeat that Boss.

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,411
We wait for that spider to eat them and fall asleep again.

10
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,329
Then we can take the mana crystal out.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,124
Do we blast it open again with flash magic?

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,668
That'll wake up the spider again.

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,672
There's a small path above the cave.

14
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,716
We go down from there.

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,968
I see.

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,720
You are a genius, Dongsuk.

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,513
But will it fall asleep?

18
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,850
If it doesn't, we'll have to take it down.

19
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,852
That guy's name is Yoo Jinho, right?

20
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,854
Did you see his equipment?

21
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,398
Just the sword and shield alone are worth hundreds of millions.

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,861
If we can't take the mana crystal, we'll take his belongings instead.

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,573
Let me see which wealthy family he's from.

24
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,242
At least we should attend the funeral.

25
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,619
By the way,

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:23,083
the noise we made when sealing the road must have infuriated that Boss a lot.

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,043
Kyuhwan.

28
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,921
Do you think you can kill that beast by yourself?

29
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,799
How could I possibly do that?

30
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,801
Honestly, me neither.

31
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,136
Boss in Dungeon cannot be underestimated.

32
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,891
In other words, those two

33
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,478
can't possibly leave there alive.

34
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,480
Please wait.

35
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,233
At least a B-Rank hunter can defeat a C-Rank Boss alone.

36
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,528
Or a top-tier C-Rank hunter.

37
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,279
Jinwoo, you can't do it...

38
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,199
Let's find a way to get out.

39
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,868
Jinho is right.

40
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,205
Even though I've had a second awakening and leveled up,

41
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,915
I am still very weak now.

42
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,670
The Venom-Fanged Kasaka in the instance dungeon

43
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,171
should be D-Rank.

44
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,758
That Golem Boss is probably D-Rank or lower.

45
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,639
This Boss is worlds apart from those.

46
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,308
But why?

47
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,979
I can't feel any pressure that would frustrate me.

48
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,609
I've become strong enough to no longer fear a C-Rank Boss.

49
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,280
My current level is 18.

50
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,450
Against a C-Rank Boss...

51
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,204
I have a chance of fighting it.

52
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,837
Hunters are called hunters

53
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,507
because the real hunt begins now.

54
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,608
You've worked hard.

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,989
Government officials, media, and energy-related groups.

56
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,409
Having meetings with them for days in a row is truly exhausting.

57
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,913
I've never been good at beating around the bush.

58
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,753
I heard you have no plans coming up.

59
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,716
If possible, could I ask you for a sparring match?

60
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,927
Perhaps it could change your mood.

61
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,474
I am already a withered veteran...

62
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,396
But how can I refuse when a young person seeks my guidance?

63
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,407
Its hide is very hard.

64
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,996
Its attack is surprisingly powerful.

65
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,456
If I took one hit, I would be dead.

66
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,630
That kind of move...

67
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,382
He is definitely not an E-Rank hunter.

68
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,551
Who is he?

69
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,846
Is he...

70
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,431
a False Ranker?

71
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,433
I've heard about them.

72
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,188
Very few hunters can control their magic power to deliberately get a lower rating.

73
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,441
They are called False Rankers.

74
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,610
And they are usually

75
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,488
psychopaths who take pleasure in killing.

76
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,243
Why did I come here?

77
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,412
Dad...

78
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,294
Damn it.

79
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,671
Its hide is too hard, I can't harm it at all.

80
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,882
My fatigue...

81
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,718
If it keeps increasing, it will slow me down.

82
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,554
I need to get rid of it before that happens.

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,515
Paralysis and drain.

84
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,976
This dagger's special abilities are key to victory.

85
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,687
It'll take effect if I hit its weak spot.

86
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,647
That's the spot!

87
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,487
Acid.

88
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,405
It had this trick too.

89
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,075
Tough hide and the strong acid.

90
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,619
It's tougher to deal with than I expected.

91
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,831
If this continues, I have no chance of winning.

92
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,751
I have to close the distance between us.

93
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,087
The new skill Dash.

94
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,507
Use this move to get to it.

95
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,981
If it doesn't work once,

96
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,358
Then I'll try again!

97
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,862
He's so fast.

98
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,072
But can his vitality hold up?

99
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,324
What on earth is he planning?

100
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,412
Faster.

101
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,874
Even faster.

102
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,961
Almost there...

103
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,884
Jinwoo!

104
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,236
Jinwoo!

105
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:57,578
Thankfully I didn't claim the rewards for the daily quest.

106
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,540
Otherwise, I can't even imagine the consequences.

107
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,585
Unbelievable.

108
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,255
He defeated the Boss all by himself.

109
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,882
There's no mistake.

110
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,052
He's a False Ranker.

111
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,472
How much is this worth?

112
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,474
Well...

113
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,934
Sir.

114
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,980
Do you need me to help you with the magic gem?

115
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,649
I can carry the luggage too.

116
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,528
Have some water, sir.

117
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,280
Thank...

118
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,407
Why is he suddenly calling me that?

119
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,617
Please take a rest, sir.

120
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,412
I'll mine the mana crystal.

121
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,374
What's with this kid?

122
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,420
They are still alive.

123
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,191
Are you okay?

124
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,276
Yes.

125
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,153
Thank you for your guidance.

126
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,990
I've relaxed a lot.

127
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,366
Thank you.

128
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,327
You are amazing, president.

129
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,621
There's no sign of decline in your skills.

130
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,333
No, I'm no longer as good as I used to be.

131
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,253
Jinchul, your moves have improved.

132
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,130
It seems you've done a lot of training.

133
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:36,677
Training can't increase hunters' level, but it can improve their skills.

134
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,179
Hmm.

135
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,389
{\an8}Don't take pride in the hunter's strength.

136
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,351
{\an8}Having a physical and mind training is indeed important.

137
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,146
{\an8}Especially if you're going to a dangerous place like a dungeon.

138
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,649
{\an8}After all, in such places,

139
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,528
you see the worst of people.

140
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,405
Is the Boss dead?

141
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,574
This spider is all bark and no bite.

142
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,742
What a crap.

143
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,537
With his equipment, defeating a C-Rank Boss isn't impossible.

144
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,458
Even so, it's embarrassing to lose to a D-Rank hunter.

145
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,002
Dongsuk, what should we do?

146
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,671
What else?

147
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,381
Yoo Jinho.

148
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,133
I looked you up because of your expensive equipment.

149
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,635
You are no ordinary person.

150
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,389
The president of Yoojin Construction, Yoo Myunghan.

151
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,099
He's your dad, right?

152
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,976
So what?

153
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,770
I'll give you a chance.

154
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,272
Kill Sung Jinwoo.

155
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,732
Eh?

156
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,943
You know what we do, right?

157
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,446
We kill those useless ones who just come to fill numbers

158
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,156
to take the spoils for ourselves.

159
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,366
Yoo Jinho.

160
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,618
I want you to be our accomplice.

161
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,620
If you do, I'll spare you.

162
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,955
How can I...

163
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,042
That young master killed a C-Rank BOSS on his own with that equipment.

164
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,878
It'll be troublesome if that equipment has special effects.

165
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,924
If you refuse, you can die together.

166
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,176
What's wrong?

167
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,262
What's there to hesitate about?

168
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,681
No one will know what happened here.

169
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,185
Are you afraid of that E-Rank trash?

170
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,828
Huh?

171
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,580
What?

172
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,624
Are you taking his side?

173
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,172
Dongsuk, what do we do now?

174
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,923
You start with the weaker one.

175
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,967
Have you two

176
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,096
ever killed people?

177
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,352
Urgent quest?

178
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,354
What's going on?

179
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,691
Pay attention here.

180
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,817
Take this!

181
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,326
Jinwoo!

182
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,500
Heejin.

183
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,755
Long time no see.

184
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,841
What's going on at the White Tiger Guild lately?

185
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,301
Nothing much.

186
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,969
It's the same as usual.

187
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,222
How about your Hunters Guild, Gina?

188
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,807
The same as usual too.

189
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:34,355
By the way, you went to Hunter Cha's A-Rank dungeon training, right?

190
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,689
How did it go?

191
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,441
It was awesome.

192
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,859
It ended in an instant.

193
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,530
Those A-Rank magic beasts we struggled with

194
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,036
were instantly taken down by her.

195
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,165
She defeated enemies effortlessly.

196
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,501
Needless to say, we were surprised.

197
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,045
Kihoon was quite shocked.

198
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,299
Because his goal was to become the next Captain.

199
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,468
Someone who works as hard as he would be more shocked.

200
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,222
What about your Kim Chul? Doesn't he have the same goal?

201
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,640
He also wants to be the Captain.

202
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,184
He's not a bad guy...

203
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,895
That says it all.

204
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,816
But after all, we are pretty lucky

205
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,404
as we are able to join large guilds like Hunters Guild and White Tiger Guild.

206
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,780
That's true.

207
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,781
Hmm.

208
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,619
After all, there are ominous rumors in some places.

209
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,288
Ominous rumors?

210
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,833
The teams with an abnormally high casualty rate.

211
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,917
Something like that.

212
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,132
Yoo Jinho, he's dead.

213
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,510
How can you do that?

214
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,098
How could I forget?

215
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,977
This is a place that believes in the survival of the fittest,

216
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,064
a place full of violence and deceit.

217
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,987
How could I...

218
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,451
How could I...

219
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,120
I see.

220
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,955
I've become numb,

221
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,209
careless, arrogant, and deluded.

222
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,380
Enemies.

223
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,926
The system is forcing me to kill people.

224
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,013
Does that mean it doesn't want me to die?

225
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,267
This is neither coincidence nor kindness.

226
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,271
The system needs me.

227
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,611
I must be strong.

228
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,489
Thank goodness.

229
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,784
Hey, he's still alive.

230
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,870
I see.

231
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,583
The system is using me.

232
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,461
And I am using the system too.

233
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,839
Hey, Kyuhwan, don't hold back.

234
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,926
How could I forget?

235
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,720
The weak will have everything taken from them.

236
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,597
This place is just like that.

237
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,349
You understand it very well.

238
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,060
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

239
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,812
That means...

240
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,065
You are also mentally prepared, right?

241
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,650
What?

242
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,235
What are you saying?

243
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm asking

244
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,784
{\an8}whether you are also prepared to be hunted.

245
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,955
Dongsuk, let me do it.

246
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,665
Buddy.

247
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,002
It seems like you don't quite understand the situation.

248
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,920
Mentally prepared to be hunted?

249
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,465
What can a boastful E-Rank hunter do?

250
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,634
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

251
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,606
The first one.

252
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,983
Jun... Juntae.

253
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:06,942
No way.

254
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,819
When did he have a weapon in his hand?

255
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,904
Where did he hide it?

256
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,907
Even if he was careless, Juntae was still a D-Rank hunter.

257
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,201
How could an E-Rank hunter manage to kill him?

258
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,540
I killed someone...

259
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,000
I killed...

260
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,421
I am following the system's instructions,

261
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,006
but the fact is

262
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,425
I killed someone.

263
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,887
But if I don't, I will be the one to die.

264
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,348
There's no turning back now.

265
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,519
Since only the strong can survive...

266
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,022
Go to hell!

267
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,232
- Die! - Die!

268
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,532
Huh?

269
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,118
How can an E-Rank hunter have such skills?

270
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,370
You bad guy...

271
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,418
Kyuhwan!

272
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,920
Yes.

273
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,261
Take this!

274
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,145
So strong.

275
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:30,109
I think he's even stronger than he was when fighting the Boss.

276
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,320
You wiped out my team members in an instant.

277
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,823
You've been hiding your ability.

278
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,367
You defeated the Boss too, didn't you?

279
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,161
But even if I'm also a C-Rank hunter,

280
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,413
I'm not the same as them.

281
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,749
Enhancement!

282
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,880
Even if he is as strong as a demon,

283
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,968
he must be exhausted after fighting the Boss and five hunters.

284
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,264
He relies on his speed and the special abilities of that dagger.

285
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,976
But my enhanced body is as hard as steel.

286
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,727
Your dagger

287
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,687
won't work on me.

288
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,773
Take this!

289
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,235
Captain Hwang.

290
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,444
You are very strong.

291
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,740
But let me tell you something.

292
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,496
That is...

293
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,957
I am always leveling up.

294
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,711
What... What happened?

295
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,797
He... He knocked me to the ground.

296
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,632
This guy

297
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,093
is no way an E-Rank hunter.

298
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,221
Wait! Don't kill me.

299
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,139
Please spare me.

300
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,849
Money... I'll give you money.

301
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,934
All the Mana Crystals and Magic Gems here.

302
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,644
You keep all of them.

303
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,980
Is it not enough?

304
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:50,898
I understand.

305
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,066
I'll double the money for you.

306
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,318
- I'll pay... - Three times...

307
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,821
You tried to kill me three times.

308
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,741
Are you begging me to spare your life?

309
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,409
Stop... stop!

310
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,703
Do you think you can get away with this?

311
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,415
No one will know what happened in the dungeon.

312
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,167
You said it.

313
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,003
{\an8}Bad guy!

314
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,963
{\an8}Do you know who my brother is...

315
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,814
After the Boss dies, the dungeon will begin to close.

316
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,899
Let's get out quickly.

317
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,364
Hmm...

318
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,867
All C-Rank hunters have perished.

319
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:49,456
The survivors are a D-Rank hunter and an E-Rank hunter?

320
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,291
That's right.

321
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,417
Well...

322
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,503
You.

323
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,796
Yes.

324
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,339
That sword in your hand

325
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,424
is the Claymore Kallion from the Maya Company, right?

326
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,385
It just hit the market.

327
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,719
Yeah.

328
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,931
I didn't know there'd be rewards too.

329
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,141
Skill: Murderous Intent.

330
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,854
All abilities are halved?

331
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,939
I see.

332
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,024
If you are using that equipment, I can understand.

333
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:22,364
You defeated the Boss alone and this E-Rank hunter hid away, right?

334
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,829
Thank you for your help today.

335
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,789
The investigation ends here.

336
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,250
Well...

337
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,879
Thank you, sir.

338
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,965
Hmm.

339

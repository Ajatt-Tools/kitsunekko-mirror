But you could barely even call him a Commissioner, really.  For example, budget and scope-wise, the Refugee Commissioner that's been showing up in the news lately is in an entirely different league. The Environmental Commissioner is a completely new seat, it's still a really minor position.  If you're looking for ransom, there's gotta be more valuable targets.

But you could barely even call him a Commissioner, really.  For example, budget and scope-wise, the Refugee Commissioner that's been showing up in the news lately is in an entirely different league. The Environmental Commissioner is a completely new seat, it's still a really minor position.  If you're looking for ransom, there's gotta be more valuable targets.

1
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,389
FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF NEPAL

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,058
This is Nepal.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,188
In the Himalayas,
5,000 meters above sea level,

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,857
there is a tribal village.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,861
A boy used to live there,
called the "monstrous child."

6
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,115
His name was Haru.

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,867
HARU, 15 YEARS OLD

8
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:39,456
He was the leader of the village
and the tribe's strongest warrior.

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,587
I found a lot of goats,
so caught some for you all.

10
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,800
A few years later...

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,468
Oh, you're really quite big!

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,886
AKIO KOHNO
A MAN FROM JAPAN

13
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,182
Come to Japan with me, Haru.

14
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,602
I have no doubt you will
become the mightiest kengan fighter.

15
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,774
He described what a kengan match
was to Haru...

16
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,901
and told him he was looking for a fighter.

17
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,823
He also told Haru that he'd come to Nepal
because he'd heard rumors about him.

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,242
I've been dreaming for a long time...

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,996
about fighting with my full force,
even just once.

20
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,040
But if I leave...

21
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,793
What's bothering you?

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,797
Everyone here in the village
will always support you.

23
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,466
You guys...

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,305
-This village is too small for you.
-Sir...

25
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:41,059
Go and see the outside world
with your own eyes, Haru.

26
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,938
It's always been your dream
to fight all out, hasn't it?

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,649
This isn't our last goodbye.

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,446
You can come back anytime,
after you've woken from this dream. Okay?

29
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,620
The man went back to Japan,
taking Haru with him.

30
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:05,167
He immediately adopted Haru
and secured Japanese citizenship for him.

31
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,631
What's this? Is a festival taking place?

32
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,300
There are so many more people
here than in my village.

33
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,385
Is that what they call a building?

34
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,846
It's bigger than the Himalayas!

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,890
Here comes some fatty tuna!

36
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,017
What kind of meat is this?

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,854
D... Delicious!

38
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,483
You can get food in this country
without having to hunt for it?

39
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,320
The picture's moving! No, go right!

40
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,073
Damn it! This monster turtle...

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,201
You're so easily blown away,
you dumb hick.

42
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,954
I'll hypnotize you with all this trash
and turn you into my puppet.

43
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,415
And now...

44
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,046
A life of satisfaction and overindulgence
can sometimes turn poisonous.

45
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:58,011
The poison of a luxurious lifestyle has
steadily corroded Haru's spirit.

46
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,388
Don't mess me around!

47
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,103
And then, Haru became Haruo.

48
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,188
SAYAKA KATAHARA
METSUDO KATAHARA'S DAUGHTER

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,898
Let's welcome the fighters!

50
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,281
GAME TWO

51
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,118
A hitman from the game industry.

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,248
The strongest game-loving hermit
in history is about to walk into the ring.

53
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,627
Let's see if he can triumph
at every stage of the tournament!

54
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:35,924
Standing 242 cm tall
and weighing 315 kg,

55
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,136
his kengan match record is
four wins and no losses.

56
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:45,142
He has acquired total assets
of 301 billion, 246 million yen.

57
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,144
Representing Nentendo,

58
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,147
also known as "The Destroyer,"

59
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,568
Haruo Kohno!

60
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,744
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORP.

61
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,954
He's gigantic!

62
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,332
HARUO KOHNO
FIGHTER, NENTENDO

63
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,796
-Hey... give me a snack.
-Not right now, okay?

64
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,298
Wow, he really is tremendously big.

65
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,091
SHUNKA HIYAMA
PRESIDENT, WAKASA INSURANCE

66
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,969
Akoya.

67
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,679
Can you hear me?

68
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,098
Yeah, no problem.

69
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,686
-Great.
-Let's go, Hiyama.

70
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,609
The supreme power of the state
is here on Ganryu Island.

71
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,653
Nothing can break his iron-hard body.

72
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,407
Nothing can fluster his stone-cold heart.

73
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,368
He heads up the riot squad,

74
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,705
the most fearsome unit
in the Metropolitan Police Dept.

75
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,084
Standing 191 cm tall
and weighing 114 kg,

76
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,963
his kengan match record is
39 wins and no losses.

77
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:03,011
He has amassed total assets
of 191 billion, 115 million yen.

78
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,265
Representing Wakasa Life Insurance,
also known as "The Executioner,"

79
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,560
Seishu Akoya!

80
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,151
SEISHU AKOYA
FIGHTER, WAKASA LIFE INSURANCE

81
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,738
It's time to enforce justice.

82
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:56,917
JUSTICE

83
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,138
That guy is strong.

84
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,723
RINO KURAYOSHI &amp; REI MIKAZUCHI

85
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,017
It's a different block...
but we should still be careful.

86
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,685
GENSAI KUROKI
FIGHTER, MOTOR HEAD MOTORS

87
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,937
Rei, you're very vigilant.

88
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,688
RYO INABA
FIGHTER, PENASONIC CORPORATION

89
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,899
WAKASA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

90
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,653
MUTEBA GIZENGA
FIGHTER, IWAMI HEAVY INDUSTRIES

91
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,781
Seems the thugs noticed it, too.
It's strange, isn't it?

92
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:32,911
Why do you think we feel like that
policeman has a similar aura to our own?

93
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,872
It's the battle of the Destroyer
versus the Executioner.

94
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,542
-Let's see which one will survive!
-Get set!

95
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,461
Fight!

96
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,215
I've started analyzing.

97
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,346
LIHITO

98
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,389
OHMA TOKITA

99
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,348
That fatso moves fast.

100
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,850
He's not just a big pig.

101
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,230
KAEDE AKIYAMA
NOGI, CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY

102
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,274
He did a backflip!

103
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,610
JERRY TYSON, FIGHTER, 22ND CENTURY FAX
(ELIMINATED)

104
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,530
Kohno throws his huge body
around effortlessly,

105
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,074
while weighing over 300 kg!

106
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,289
He knocked up against him!

107
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,877
Akoya has been smashed into the wall!

108
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,258
I want to play video games...

109
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,760
How is he able to move that way?

110
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,223
Haruo Kohno truly is a monster,
he's so much worse than I'd heard.

111
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,767
Do you know him, Ms. Akiyama?

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,938
There was a battle royal before,

113
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,274
for the right to develop
the next generation of consoles.

114
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,028
Every company sent
their strongest fighters

115
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,282
but the result was a resounding victory
for Haruo Kohno from Nentendo.

116
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,783
Great, Haruo.

117
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,035
AKIO KOHNO
PRESIDENT, NENTENDO

118
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,662
Finish him off quickly.

119
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,126
Ridiculous.

120
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,711
RIDICULOUS

121
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,885
SAW PAING YOROIZUKA
FIGHTER, VILLAGE OF DAWN

122
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,345
-Hey, he fended it off.
-That's the Great Shield.

123
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,014
GAOLAN WONGSAWAT
FIGHTER, YAZU TRADING

124
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,850
I’ve got it, he uses the "art of arrest"
as his fighting style.

125
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,518
Art of arrest.

126
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:26,524
Police officers in charge of criminal
investigations acquire this martial art

127
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,862
which specializes in restraining
and subduing the opponent.

128
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,322
It was developed

129
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,408
by mixing Japanese kung fu,
the Japanese art of fencing, and jujitsu,

130
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,164
to fight not only with bare hands
but also using various weapons.

131
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,125
He's just like a gladiator.

132
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,213
Still, it doesn't mean
he's immune to damage.

133
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,592
Is his body made of steel?

134
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,138
Why isn't he falling down?

135
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,228
He slashed his arm!

136
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,815
It looks like Lihito's Razor's Edge.

137
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,317
What the hell did you do?

138
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,157
That technique is radically different
to my Razor's Edge.

139
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,161
He cuts his opponent's skin
using his knuckles.

140
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,704
You're a stubborn pig.

141
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,208
I don't think he's badly injured,
despite the fact he's bleeding a lot.

142
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,961
I'd say it's more of
a harassment technique.

143
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,839
-What's wrong, Tokita?
-I'm going to bed.

144
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,883
You don't want to watch the match?

145
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,344
Neither of them are serious.

146
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,972
It'd be a waste of time
watching them fight.

147
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,601
Not serious?

148
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,354
Akoya, I'm done.

149
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,816
-I've finished analyzing.
-Roger.

150
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,860
Let's finish this.

151
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,698
BEAR KILLER

152
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,535
LOW RIGHT FOOT EDGE KICK

153
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,912
LOW LEFT PUNCH

154
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,331
RIGHT PALM HEEL PUNCH

155
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,670
A counter!

156
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,088
Haruo!

157
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,090
You bastar--

158
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,221
Wow! Akoya's stream of attacks
just won't stop!

159
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,267
I hate you!

160
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,561
He surely can't escape this!

161
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,488
It's not fair to take off your clothes!

162
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
Just surrender.

163
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,243
Your attacks won't reach me anymore.

164
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,539
For the sake of justice,
you shall die right now.

165
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:54,964
You guys are unlucky.
You pissed off our boss.

166
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,424
Stop this now.

167
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,263
I am going to enforce justice.

168
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,560
That was a close one.

169
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,897
They sent their hatchet men after us
just for stealing their boss's car.

170
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,899
They're crazy!

171
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,276
And... who are you?

172
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,906
Shoot me.
I'll let you go if you can kill me.

173
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,115
What?

174
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,953
You jerks stole a car belonging
to the boss of a yakuza group.

175
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:29,082
Then, while you were escaping,
you knocked someone down.

176
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,043
Luckily, the victim was
only slightly injured.

177
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,879
But I don't give a shit about that.

178
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,633
That's not sufficient reason
to let scum like you live.

179
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,011
That's insane.
You're going to kill me just for that?

180
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,682
If you want to kill someone,
kill those yakuza bastards instead!

181
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,600
TADASHI KATO
LEADER OF GODO-KAI

182
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,937
Don't worry.
They've already been executed.

183
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,274
You're mad!

184
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,445
Justice enforced.

185
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,119
SEISHU AKOYA
CAPT. 44TH RIOT SQUAD

186
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,331
Well done. Get in.

187
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,292
SHUNKA HIYAMA
PRESIDENT, WAKASA LIFE INSURANCE

188
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,584
I'll take you home.

189
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,796
Hiyama. I told you not to come.

190
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,341
So, how long are you
going to keep doing this?

191
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,178
-How about taking a break?
-Don't be ridiculous.

192
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,183
Justice doesn't rest.
I'll keep fighting...

193
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,770
until the day evil is finally rooted out.

194
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:41,946
It's useless.

195
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,033
Your attacks won't hit me anymore.

196
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,037
Don't you think that technique looks
quite similar to your attack prediction?

197
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,664
RYO HIMURO
GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP'S PREVIOUS FIGHTER

198
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,915
Actually, no.

199
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,376
SUEKICHI KANEDA
GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP'S CURRENT FIGHTER

200
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,795
At first glance, it looks the same
as my attack prediction.

201
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,922
But I feel something different.

202
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,010
Don't take it seriously, Haruo.
He's bluffing!

203
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,262
What are you waiting for, you slug?

204
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,890
You don't want to be sent back
to your country, do you?

205
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,602
Return there?

206
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,065
To the village with no games,
no comics, and no computers?

207
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,068
No.

208
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,737
I'm not going back there!

209
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,035
-He stabbed the wound!
-That rat!

210
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,165
The true purpose of the technique he used
was to enable him to gouge the flesh.

211
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,126
As I thought, he's an asshole.

212
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,008
TWO LIVER SHOTS

213
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,095
-Liver shots.
-That sure worked.

214
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,763
Something's weird.

215
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,683
I don't know how to say this,
but Akoya looks like...

216
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,187
he's being manipulated by someone else.

217
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,198
Damn! Why aren't my attacks reaching him?

218
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,909
MIDDLE RIGHT ROUND KICK

219
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,661
Okay, perfect.

220
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,622
What I analyze is intervals.

221
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,959
In other words,
the timing of a person's breathing.

222
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,462
That's the moment a man is
at his most vulnerable.

223
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,049
Everyone has
their own pattern of breathing.

224
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,430
Using my biological clock, I analyze
the opponent's breathing pattern.

225
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,934
The signals I then send to Akoya
depend upon the pattern. That's it.

226
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,730
That's all I can do,
because I only have ordinary reflexes.

227
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,233
The game plan works

228
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,238
because my partner is Akoya and he has
extraordinary natural reflexes.

229
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,826
He is a combat machine which I manipulate.

230
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,328
It should even be possible for us...

231
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,999
to win against Fang of Metsudo now.

232
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:04,964
He's injured!

233
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,384
I am strong!

234
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,012
In the Himalayas,

235
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,223
I am the strongest!

236
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,561
-Akoya, it's time to finish him.
-Understood.

237
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,238
I have no mercy for anyone
who disrupts justice.

238
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,535
Enforcement complete.

239
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,585
Haruo! What the hell are you doing?

240
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,587
You're a useless piece of crap!

241
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,591
-Stand up, Haruo!
-Can you continue, Kohno?

242
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,094
Bring a stretcher! Hurry up now!

243
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,971
The winner--

244
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,310
What the...

245
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,985
He's unconscious.

246
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,239
But he has some murderous aura.

247
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,241
Look at that.

248
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,493
He's back.

249
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,538
Right, chief.

250
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,501
Haru, the strongest soldier of
the Himalayas, has come back.

251
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,337
I don't... lose.

252
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,341
A warrior... never loses.

253
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,303
His fighting instinct made him get up even
though he hasn't regained consciousness.

254
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,849
Even so, a man who's been battered like
he has shouldn't be able to stand.

255
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,604
It's not a problem, Akoya.
Haruo Kohno's already been analyzed.

256
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,359
No matter how many times he stands up,
he'll never be able to win against us.

257
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,072
So quick! Has his breathing changed?

258
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,326
The weight of his blows has increased.

259
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,580
What on earth has happened to him?

260
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,333
Hang in there, Akoya. I'll reanalyze him.

261
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:09,297
After moving to Japan,
he changed completely,

262
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,800
and enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle.

263
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:18,139
But that is the true form of Haru,
the strongest of all Gurkhas.

264
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,557
GURKHA SOLDIERS

265
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,602
Gurkha soldiers are
a fierce band of mercenaries.

266
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,188
The mixed troop consists
of several mountain tribes.

267
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,442
Having been raised in
the harshest of environments,

268
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,404
they possess a toughness which those
living in the lowlands can never match.

269
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,992
Throughout history, political leaders
from all over the world have hired them.

270
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,955
One man was said to be
the strongest of all Gurkha soldiers.

271
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:48,169
They feared him, believing him
to be the incarnation of Indra.

272
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,129
That man is Haru.

273
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,218
He's unstoppable!

274
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,139
Kohno continues his
one-sided pummelling of Akoya.

275
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,726
Is this the same man who was
on the backfoot only minutes ago?

276
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,187
I need a little more time.

277
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,024
Sorry, Akoya.
Hang in there for a few more minutes.

278
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,944
Hurry up, Hiyama.
You don't have much time.

279
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,447
Gee, what a spectacle!

280
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,033
Wait, what's that?

281
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,703
His face looks...

282
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,875
Greed is a deadly poison
that corrupts people.

283
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:32,755
His emerging instinct
as the God of War is rejecting the poison.

284
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,843
His speed has increased again.

285
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,930
-I need to recalculate.
-You don't need to.

286
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,516
Time's up, Hiyama.

287
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,561
Wow, look at those fierce punches!

288
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,815
He's raining blows down upon him
like a pneumatic hammer!

289
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,526
Is there nothing left for Akoya to do?

290
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,654
Can you hear me, Akoya?

291
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:02,034
I can finish analyzing in 15...
No, 12 seconds. Please, Akoya.

292
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,161
Follow my command.

293
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,705
Save your breath, Hiyama.

294
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,791
I told you, time's up.

295
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,963
Haruo Kohno will die...
because of your incompetence.

296
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,092
Haruo Kohno.

297
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,970
You must die for justice.

298
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,765
It hurts!

299
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,479
His knee has already
reached its critical limit.

300
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:36,235
It must've always been under massive
strain due to his great weight.

301
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,156
In addition, it's taken a
tremendous kicking from Akoya.

302
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,659
His knee must surely
be at its breaking-point!

303
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,084
You have had a narrow escape.

304
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,173
The...

305
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,008
The game is over!

306
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,220
The winner is Seishu Akoya.

307
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,723
Justice doesn't lose.

308
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,476
I can't believe this...

309
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,894
Haru!

310
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,690
It's up to you, Haru, whether
you repent or keep falling.

311
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,235
You must make the decision on your own.

312
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,155
-Sen.
-I know.

313
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,365
He was outrageous as usual.

314
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,243
SEN HATSUMI, FIGHTER, NOGI GROUP
HIDEKI NOGI, CHAIRMAN, NOGI GROUP

315
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,287
He withstood every single attack
from that monster,

316
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,581
shifting the impact point every time.

317
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,750
That's Seishu Akoya.

318
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,128
His defense is one of the hardest
to break of all the kengan fighters.

319
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:40,216
The Metropolitan Police Department keeps
an exceptional monster as its pet.

320
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,967
Akoya!

321
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,680
Sorry, I panicked when he
made those unexpected moves

322
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,849
and my analysis was delayed.

323
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,894
I don't want any excuses.

324
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,398
You held me back. That's the truth of it.

325
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,609
You've disappointed me, Hiyama.

326
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,654
I'll play the next match alone.

327
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,032
No... you can't do that, Akoya!

328
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,451
If you do that, you could...

329
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,915
Please, think it over.
I promise not to make any more mistakes.

330
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,502
I'll do anything you want.

331
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,797
Don't abandon me. I'm begging you.

332
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,178
I'll punish you later.

333
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,265
This will be the last time
I forgive you, Hiyama.

334
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,187
Understood.

335
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,862
PREVIEW

336
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,239
The successor to Baritsu,
the mythical martial art,

337
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,408
fights an assassin from a taboo species.

338
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,287
With pride running through each
family tree, which bloodline will survive?

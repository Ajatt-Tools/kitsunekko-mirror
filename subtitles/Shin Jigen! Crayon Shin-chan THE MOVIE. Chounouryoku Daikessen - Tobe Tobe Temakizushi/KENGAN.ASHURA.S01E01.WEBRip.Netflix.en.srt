1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,389
KABUKICHO ICHIBANGAI

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,728
It was in a blind spot
in a forest of neon signs,

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,482
the shadow of buildings that
nobody would usually pay attention to.

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,237
But somehow, at that time,
he glanced in the direction.

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,823
In a small open space
behind the buildings,

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,202
a mortal combat was about to begin.

7
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,871
Are they going to have a fight?

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,793
Fighting against such a big man,
he'll get himself killed.

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,712
You're insane.

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,923
Had you observed me more carefully,

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:53,136
you'd have realized I'm not a decent man
and much stronger than you are.

12
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,557
But you picked a fight with me.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,850
I'm sure you're not sane.

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,477
He is absolutely right.

15
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,104
Huh?

16
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,359
You're stronger than me?

17
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,238
Don't talk nonsense.
Just show me how strong you are.

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,614
Big shit.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,992
What? Seriously?!

20
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,035
Now he's a dead man.

21
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,830
I'm totally right.

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,040
You're insane.

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,421
The big man looked
just like the guardian God Nio.

24
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,172
In fact,

25
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,844
the guardian God was sitting on his back.

26
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,140
What's that body?!
He's like the Terminator.

27
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,851
There is no way
he can beat that monster down.

28
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,189
He's used to fighting as I thought.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,777
Too fast!
How can a huge guy like him move so fast?

30
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,657
That's not it.

31
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:56,867
His advantage is...

32
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,623
He crushed the concrete wall
with just one kick!

33
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,003
I knew it. Those are iron-plated boots.

34
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,173
I really don't want to get those kicks.

35
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,176
There's no way he can win.

36
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,555
A slender handsome guy easily beats
a man of gigantic build?

37
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,017
That always happens in fiction.
But...

38
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,896
Fantasy like that has no chance
to exist in the real world.

39
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,689
Hey...

40
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,067
Stop running around.

41
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,611
This is the fight you picked.

42
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,031
-Now it's your turn--
-Okay. Here I come!

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,246
Son of a bitch!

44
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,420
He's injured.

45
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,339
Now you understand...

46
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,634
Which one of us is the challenger, huh?

47
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,224
Well, well...

48
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,894
I'll get the power of his punch...

49
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,231
fully turned back on him.

50
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,359
Wow.

51
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,695
Your arm is completely dislocated.

52
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,154
I can still--

53
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,032
Still what?

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,368
You're wrong.

55
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,581
You've been finished already.

56
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,467
He...

57
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,971
He won!

58
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,306
It's done.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,856
Y-- Your name...

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,775
May I have your name?

61
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,612
The question just came out of his mouth.

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,116
Though the man was as young as his sons,

63
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:06,371
the highest respect for a stronger male
clearly arose in his heart.

64
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,416
Ohma Tokita.

65
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,545
Mr. Ohma Tokita...

66
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,172
And...

67
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,299
your name is?

68
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,551
Oh, you're...

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,220
asking my name?

70
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,432
I'm...

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,146
I am Kazuo Yamashita, sir!

72
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,816
You're Kazuo Yamashita?

73
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,152
Okay.

74
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,779
Then...

75
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,324
you want to fight, too?

76
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,700
What?!

77
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,745
What pressure!

78
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,997
This can't be a joke.

79
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,749
He's serious.

80
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,335
I'll be killed.

81
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,921
I can't breathe...

82
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,548
No.

83
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,676
You don't?

84
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,429
That's disappointing.

85
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,488
Kazuo Yamashita, 56 years old.

86
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,199
He is a serious, married man
with two sons.

87
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,495
The man who in the prime of his life never
drunk, gambled or paid for sex,

88
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,542
slept with a woman that night
for the first time in 15 years.

89
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,919
What urged him was...

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,547
the instinct of self-preservation.

91
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,885
Exposed to an extremely murderous
atmosphere that he'd never experienced,

92
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,430
his instinct immediately sensed
the great danger of life.

93
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,393
Feeling cornered, he chose instinctively
to preserve the species

94
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,894
as soon as possible.

95
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,523
Therefore, he ended up
being engaged in reproductive activity.

96
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,653
However, he never knew
what caused him to do it.

97
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,877
KENGAN

98
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,923
NOGI PUBLICATIONS

99
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,466
Yamashita.

100
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,761
You're below quota this month, too.

101
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,014
I sincerely apologize for it.

102
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,766
I'll make it next month for sure.

103
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,560
KAZUO YAMASHITA
NOGI PUBLICATIONS, NOGI GROUP

104
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,771
"Next month"?
You say the same thing every month.

105
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,607
HIROSHI MATSUI
NOGI PUBLICATIONS, NOGI GROUP

106
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,650
To be honest,
your words are not very convincing.

107
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,279
Chief is picking on Mr. Yamashita again.

108
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,158
Dumping all the bothersome tasks
on to Mr. Yamashita, Chief does nothing.

109
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,785
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes, of course!

110
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,412
I have no excuse.

111
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,666
Darn it! He's just a kid
who got his job through nepotism.

112
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,962
If I were as strong as that man,

113
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,883
I would treat this jerk like this!

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,843
Am I stupid?

115
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,347
I'm bowing because I can't do that.

116
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,057
Sorry to disturb you.

117
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,934
President!

118
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,227
If you needed me,
you could have called me to your office.

119
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,979
FUTOSHI HOSOME
NOGI PUBLICATIONS, NOGI GROUP

120
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,564
It's not you whom I want to see.

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,524
Yamashita.

122
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,153
Someone special wants to have
a private word with you.

123
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,114
Visit him immediately
to ask what he needs.

124
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,240
Huh?

125
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,283
Um...

126
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,786
Is it really him?

127
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,621
Oh, man...

128
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,334
What kind of mess did you make?

129
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,585
Sorry?

130
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,008
NOGI GROUP HEADQUARTERS

131
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,474
Thank you for taking your time.

132
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,059
HIDEKI NOGI,
CHAIRMAN OF NOGI GROUP

133
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,103
Sorry to bother you while you're busy.

134
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,272
No problem at all, sir!

135
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,652
A mere cog of one of the subsidiaries
is summoned

136
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,862
by the chairman of the group companies?

137
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,699
What on earth did I do?

138
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,243
Conflicts.

139
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,164
What do you think is the best way...

140
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,709
to solve a conflict?

141
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,254
To solve... a conflict?

142
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,672
Right.

143
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,884
The word "solve" is simple,
but we have millions of ways to do it,

144
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,263
such as by mediating, negotiating,
and persuading.

145
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,598
The most effective one is...

146
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,892
by using violence.

147
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,187
U-- Using violence?

148
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:46,359
You bear down on your enemy with violence
which overwhelms them.

149
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,446
That doesn't solve a conflict itself.

150
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,451
You're right.

151
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,582
Of course, violence could be
effective as a safety system,

152
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,753
but that's only
when the violence is under control.

153
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,132
We can gain nothing
from disorganized violence.

154
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,135
That would only result in
unstoppable tyrannies.

155
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:20,268
In 1715, although the Edo period was
such a peaceful age,

156
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:26,691
the bloody conflicts among merchants
existed at all times.

157
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:34,491
What they desired was the highest and
exclusive privilege as a merchant:

158
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,870
to be a vendor to the Imperial Court.

159
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:46,127
They used every possible way, such as
threat, conspiracy or assassination...

160
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,716
to kick their competitors out
of their business field.

161
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,178
The chain of violence
had expanded so widely...

162
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:01,768
that even the merchants themselves
had no way of controlling it.

163
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,939
The world was about to descend
into pandemonium.

164
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,153
The times needed some rules...

165
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,490
to control the fighting.

166
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,619
Ietsugu Tokugawa, the 7th shogun,

167
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,414
summoned the merchants
at the center of the troubles,

168
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,875
and he gave them an order.

169
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,715
If you want to settle a fight,
you should have a clean showdown.

170
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,762
It was such a simple and straight
suggestion from a child.

171
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,348
However, nobody among them

172
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:45,854
could come up with this simple answer.

173
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,982
As you wish.

174
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,527
Order was brought to violence.

175
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,825
The merchants organized an association
through which they held a match

176
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,871
when there was a conflict of interests
among them.

177
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,875
The rule was quite simple:

178
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,919
a one-on-one battle, unarmed.

179
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,673
The highly skilled fighters
hired by both sides

180
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,092
fought each other on behalf
of the merchants

181
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,011
until the winner was announced.

182
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:24,017
In due course, violence was
developed into a martial art.

183
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,772
One of the association members was
my ancestor.

184
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:36,362
Nogi Group owes him
its current prosperity.

185
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,573
So what?

186
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,867
What's the point of this story?

187
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,913
Do you understand
why I'm telling this story to you?

188
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,459
The story is not just an old tale.

189
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:55,590
It's a traditional fighting method
still practiced by merchants today.

190
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,635
Oh, no... Are you joking?

191
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,054
It's too hard for me to believe it.

192
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,765
He seems so serious.

193
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,726
Was he telling the truth?

194
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,398
Even after Japan has been modernized,
the merchants have handed down

195
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,737
this duel system for generations
to solve their conflicts.

196
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,616
Setting your hopes on the fighter's fists
is the meaning of...

197
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,786
"kengan match."

198
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,957
What's a kengan match?!

199
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,669
In fact, we're going to have a match
in a few days

200
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,546
with some other companies
over a specific right.

201
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,217
But we have a little problem.

202
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:46,266
The man we originally hired is unable
to join the match for some reasons.

203
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,853
We need to look
for another fighter, quickly.

204
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,648
Oh, no...

205
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,150
Are you telling me to fight?

206
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,029
That's not a bad idea.

207
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,533
Unfortunately, that won't be necessary.

208
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,911
As soon as we started recruiting
a new fighter,

209
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,622
a man came to us and offered himself.

210
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,835
We decided to leave this match up to him.

211
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,258
Here he comes.

212
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:28,933
Unbelievable!
Is he going to be the substitute fighter?

213
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,437
Let me introduce our fighter to you.

214
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,384
He is Ohma Tokita.

215
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:35,240
OHMA TOKITA
AFFILIATED FIGHTER OF NOGI GROUP

216
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,275
Good to see you again, Kazuo Yamashita.

217
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:39,652
It's my pleasure to see you again, too.

218
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,406
What a miraculous coincidence!

219
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,243
Oh, you two know each other?

220
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,954
That would be even more convenient.

221
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,081
Kazuo Yamashita.

222
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,461
I'll assign you to take care of him.

223
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,047
Tokita.

224
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,760
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask him.

225
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,470
All right.

226
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,890
Why don't you have a meeting
to discuss the future plan?

227
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,601
Details will be announced later.

228
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,899
Was it really a good idea...

229
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,276
to trust that man?

230
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,782
The one who beat Komada is probably...

231
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,076
I believe that's him.

232
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,244
That's why I hired him.

233
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,084
How many people in the world
do you think can take Komada down?

234
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,044
Ohma Tokita.

235
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,671
We were very lucky to find him.

236
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,048
What about the other one?

237
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,404
Kazuo Yamashita.

238
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,933
KAEDE AKIYAMA, SECRETARY TO
THE OFFICE OF CHAIRMAN OF NOGI GROUP

239
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:47,920
He's just an employee of
one of our subsidiaries.

240
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:51,158
Why did you tell him
what a kengan match is, sir?

241
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:56,187
We have plenty of other people
better at taking care of the fighter.

242
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,064
Well...

243
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,816
No special reason.

244
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,567
Excuse me?

245
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,821
Don't get so annoyed.

246
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,409
I assigned him not only for support,
but also to keep an eye on him for safety.

247
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,244
That's all.

248
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,705
It doesn't explain why you chose him, sir.

249
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,126
Is it because you don't want
to tell me about it?

250
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,253
Ohma Tokita.

251
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,338
I'll find out...

252
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,008
what kind of man you are.

253
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,806
Please... please wait!

254
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,060
What's wrong, Kazuo Yamashita?

255
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,895
Why does he call me by my full name?

256
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:43,359
Mr. Tokita.
You should decline his offer.

257
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,154
Fighting a duel is a crime.

258
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,281
How could Chairman Nogi think such--

259
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,616
Hey, first of all...

260
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,952
let's go eat.

261
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,330
Yes.

262
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,000
"Let's go eat."

263
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,629
Spoken by him,
such a simple phrase like this

264
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,383
sounds so violent
that it's impossible for you to resist.

265
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,887
In Ohma Tokita's dictionary,

266
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:15,141
the word "reconsidering"
doesn't even exist in the first place.

267
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,894
SEVEN DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE KENGAN MATCH!

268
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,988
Good morning, everyone.

269
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,033
I am Kazuo Yamashita.

270
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,286
I've been working for Nogi Publications
for 34 years.

271
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,831
At age 56, I'm still
in my most productive years.

272
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,209
"Having a fulfilling private life,

273
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,961
I'm satisfied every day."

274
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,963
That's not my case.

275
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,382
Your breakfast...

276
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,676
is here.

277
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,645
That's my older son, Kenzo.

278
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,149
If I'm right,
he'll turn 25 years old this year.

279
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,945
Since junior high school, he's been
shutting himself away from society

280
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,488
up until now.

281
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:15,243
The last time I saw his face was
two years-- No, three years ago, maybe.

282
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:21,749
My younger son has got rebellious since
he dropped out of high school last year.

283
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,877
He's hanging out with bad friends.

284
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:30,174
He only comes back home
to steal money from my wallet.

285
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,264
My wife ran away from us ten years ago.

286
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,060
I still don't know why she dumped me.

287
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:48,943
I only have this house
on a small patch of land left

288
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:53,114
with the mortgage to be paid
for 15 years more.

289
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,450
This is just where I'm going to die.

290
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,217
Is this here?

291
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,804
I think I followed the map correctly.

292
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,642
So this is really... Ohma's house?

293
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,396
It's an abandoned building, isn't it?

294
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,694
Of course, it's broken.

295
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,200
Excuse me.

296
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,203
Ohma?

297
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,542
Have I come to the wrong place?

298
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,130
Ohma.

299
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,549
Are you home?

300
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,512
The floor has completely rotted away.

301
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,807
What was that?

302
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,435
What's going on?

303
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,363
I'm coming in.

304
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,782
Ohma.

305
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,006
Blood!

306
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,384
Stay away, murderer!

307
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,843
What are you doing?

308
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,595
Oh?

309
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,889
Ohma.

310
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,602
What are you doing?
You are badly injured.

311
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,522
I'll call the ambulance right now.

312
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,482
Ah, this?

313
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,401
It's not mine.

314
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,069
I was removing blood.

315
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,862
What? Removing blood?

316
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,073
Yeah, from that.

317
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,408
"That"?

318
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,496
You're such a noisy guy.

319
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,710
Sure you don't want any?

320
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,545
Oh, I'm sorry.

321
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,755
I'm not hungry.

322
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,007
That's a shame.

323
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,596
Just look at that extraordinary body!

324
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,642
Aesthetically speaking,
it's top-ranking anatomy.

325
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,312
It's like an ancient Greek statue.

326
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,150
Hey, what am I thinking?

327
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,986
I don't have that kind
of preference at all.

328
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,405
By the way, Ohma.

329
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,741
How on earth did you get that boar?

330
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,117
I killed it.

331
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,746
Killed? Why did you do a thing like that?

332
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,664
"Why"?

333
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,750
What else do you normally eat?

334
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,252
You kill something to live.

335
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,338
That's correct.

336
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,633
No matter how much civilization advances,

337
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,052
our nature will not change.

338
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,097
Now we enjoy the end product only.

339
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,476
Paying no attention to the procedure
which surely exists.

340
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,855
We kill and eat to live,
just like he does.

341
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:17,276
What a straight and simple answer!

342
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,905
But simple words can directly
convey the true story.

343
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,491
I see the reality in it.

344
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,120
Ohma's words are definitely true.

345
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,915
Hey.

346
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,083
Kazuo Yamashita.

347
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,836
You brought your buddies today?

348
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,004
Pardon?

349
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,469
What?!

350
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,520
What a mess.

351
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,689
How can you live in such a dump?

352
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,776
Who are those people?

353
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,611
What do you want?

354
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,571
Soliciting? No thanks.

355
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,281
I'll take care of this.

356
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,950
Don't interfere.

357
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,202
All right.

358
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,664
I see it... a fighterâ€™s spirit.

359
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,458
Wait. Hold on a second.

360
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,711
Is it possible that he is Ivan Karaev?

361
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,088
You know him?

362
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,676
He's a Russian kickboxer
who's been standing out recently.

363
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,970
What is he doing here?

364
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,721
Nothing personal.

365
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,682
This is just business.

366
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,561
You're going to have to stay in bed
for a while.

367
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,071
PREVIEW

368
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,657
Extraordinary techniques
and gifts of heaven.

369
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,284
A strong enemy beyond human rules

370
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,578
stands like a wall before Ashura.

371
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,498
The crisis level is immeasurable.

1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,893
Back when I was a young student,
I watched a foreign movie.

2
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,814
I still remember the party scene
on a luxury cruise ship.

3
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:28,111
I was deeply impressed by
how gorgeous and exquisite it was.

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,407
"I want to join such a party someday.

5
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,410
To make it happen,
I will work my way up in society!"

6
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,957
It might have been my youth
that motivated me that way.

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,876
Decades have passed since then.

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,128
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

9
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,799
I wish I could tell my young self...
that one day my dream would come true!

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,385
Although it comes with a huge debt.

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,235
This is a whole different world to me.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,487
OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

13
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,407
-I prefer the other ship to this one.
-Mr. Yamashita, Ohma.

14
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,868
Mr. Nogi!

15
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,538
HIDEKI NOGI
CHAIRMAN, NOGI GROUP

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,542
It's been a while, Ohma. Congratulations
on getting through to the tournament.

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,962
I won my place in the tournament myself,
the way you suggested.

18
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,882
But that doesn't mean
that I'm going to be your pawn.

19
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:06,978
PULLING STRINGS

20
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,025
Come on, Kaede. Don't be so heartless.

21
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,486
KAEDE AKIYAMA,
CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY, NOGI GROUP

22
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,989
-Can I get your number at least?
-You're being too persistent, Lihito.

23
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,160
Besides, shouldn't you
be with your employer right now?

24
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,912
My employer?

25
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,665
I don't have one. I'm on my own.

26
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,877
As a matter of fact,
I'm the president of SH Frozen Storage.

27
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,921
LIHITO
PRESIDENT AND FIGHTER, SH FROZEN STORAGE

28
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,880
What?

29
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,676
Does that mean
you're a president and a fighter?

30
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,553
Surprised?

31
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,014
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for your boss,

32
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,684
-Chairman Nogi.
-Hey. Get away from me.

33
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,520
I was fired as a fighter

34
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:53,108
and got a part-time job
for a shipping company under Nogi Group.

35
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,776
They paid me well.

36
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,739
Then one day,
Nogi visited me unexpectedly.

37
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,951
His words made me snap out of my stupor.

38
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,873
Lihito, you're not the type of person
who deserves to work under others.

39
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,250
You should start your own company at once.

40
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,085
You think so too?

41
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,923
I'll entrust you with a food company
we bought out recently.

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,051
Wow! But hold on a second.

43
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:24,097
Being a president does appeal to me,
but I want to be a fighter again.

44
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,265
Don't worry.

45
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,603
You'll make a comeback
as the first ever "president fighter."

46
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,814
Wow. The first ever?
That sounds awesome!

47
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,066
-You just need to sign this contract.
-Okay!

48
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,528
-I'll lend you as much money as you need.
-Okay!

49
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,698
All you'll need is the challenge fee
to get membership

50
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,909
and then the entry fee to the tournament.

51
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,578
-It's not very much at all.
-Okay!

52
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,665
-It's only five billion yen in total.
-Okay!

53
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,880
That's how I made
a sudden comeback to kengan matches.

54
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,008
He's been conned.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,010
You've succeeded then.

56
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,387
-So, if you win...
-He won't.

57
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,016
...will you become the chairman
of the Kengan Association?

58
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,394
What? Don't you know anything?

59
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,355
If I win the tournament,

60
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,108
-I must designate Nogi as the chairman.
-What?

61
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,112
-It's part of the contract.
-Designate him?

62
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,074
-Is that allowed, Ms. Akiyama?
-Yes.

63
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:29,788
The reward for winning the tournament
is the right to designate the chairman.

64
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,960
The choice of the next chairman
is in the hands of the winning company.

65
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,879
Yamashita Corporation
has the same contract.

66
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,675
The more participants you control,
the more of an advantage you have.

67
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,012
Mr. Nogi didn't tell me any of this.

68
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,473
Wait a second.

69
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,852
Ms. Akiyama, does that mean...

70
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,065
I suppose other companies
are probably using the same tactics as us.

71
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,444
Many companies drag other companies
into their own camp

72
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,156
through buyouts,
conciliation and coercion.

73
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,660
This is what will be
happening behind the scenes.

74
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,749
This tournament is essentially
a stratagem battle between companies

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,836
to secure the position of chairman.

76
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,715
-Basically, we just need to win.
-Yeah.

77
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,181
I don't feel comfortable
in a fancy place like this.

78
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,768
What's going on there?

79
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,440
NAOYA OHKUBO
FIGHTER, MUJI TELEVISION NETWORK

80
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,153
That's the absolute champion
of ultimate fighting, Naoya Ohkubo.

81
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,363
Wait, why are they playing Japanese chess?

82
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,907
Hey, Kazu!

83
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,742
Ken!

84
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,243
KEN OHYA
GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP CHAIRMAN

85
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,789
-I've been looking for you.
-Is everything all right?

86
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,334
Kazu, you're good
at Japanese chess, aren't you?

87
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,128
Well, yeah. I believe so.

88
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,255
Avenge me and beat him.

89
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,507
I can't win
no matter how many times I try.

90
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,760
Really? You lost against Ohkubo?

91
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,762
Not him. That guy!

92
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,141
There. That's checkmate.

93
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,270
Goddamn it! Why can't I win?

94
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,022
SUEKICHI KANEDA
JAPANESE CHESS PLAYER

95
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,567
Well, too bad.
I look forward to your next challenge.

96
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,321
Now, is there anyone else
who would like to challenge me?

97
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,073
The challenge fee is 10,000 yen.

98
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,158
If you win, I will give you 100,000 yen...

99
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,079
Gambling on Japanese chess? Here?
Who is he anyway?

100
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,208
That's my friend, Suekichi Kaneda.
He's from outside of the kengan world.

101
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,044
Why did you bring an outsider here?

102
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:46,049
I met him at a Japanese chess center
yesterday and we became friends.

103
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,677
We went for drinks and really hit it off.

104
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,055
I invited him on the spur of the moment.

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,935
Oh? Mr. Ohya.
Is that the man you were talking about?

106
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,770
Yes, this is Mr. Yamashita.

107
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,690
He has 50 yearsâ€™ experience
in Japanese chess.

108
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:07,278
Wow. You must really be a tough one.
I hope you go easy on me.

109
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,991
This guy must underestimate me.

110
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,826
All right.

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,370
Let me show you my skills.

112
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,500
People used to call me
"Kazu the Twisting Rook." Behold.

113
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,128
There. Checkmate.

114
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,130
What!

115
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,465
That's the fifth time
in a row that I've lost!

116
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,094
Don't beat yourself up so much.
You did a fine job.

117
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,973
Even Kazu couldn't match him.

118
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,058
He's pretty good.

119
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,977
TAKAYUKI CHIBA
FIGHTER, YOSHITAKE REAL ESTATE

120
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,396
It's as if he can see
his opponent's every move in advance.

121
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,607
Hey, look. Isn't that Chairman Katahara?

122
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,277
-It's him!
-It's Chairman Katahara!

123
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,946
What's he doing up there?

124
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,200
Thank you all for waiting.
Let's get started.

125
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,203
METSUDO KATAHARA, GOVERNOR OF DAINIPPON
BANK &amp; KENGAN ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN

126
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,705
SEN HATSUMI
FIGHTER, NOGI GROUP

127
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,540
Here he is, the monster geezer.

128
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,335
The ship will arrive at the battlefield

129
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,464
in about 27 hours from now.

130
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,884
Twenty-seven hours? That's a long trip.

131
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,556
Upon arriving at the battlefield,
you must register your fighters.

132
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:23,521
This will see them entered officially
into the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament.

133
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,524
Entered officially? What does that mean?

134
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,484
One more thing.

135
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,781
Private battles between kengan fighters
on this ship are firmly prohibited.

136
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,700
Those who break this order will
be sanctioned by the Guards.

137
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,786
THE GUARDS
PRIVATE ARMY OF METSUDO KATAHARA

138
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,579
That's all.

139
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,042
You may return to enjoying the voyage.

140
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,170
I see. This is just...

141
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,671
Perfect.

142
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,051
-Nogi.
-Oh! It's been a long time.

143
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,969
SHION SORYUIN
CHAIRWOMAN, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

144
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,472
-Ms. Soryuin.
-Let's skip the pleasantries.

145
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,934
What did you think
of the chairman's speech?

146
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,104
Oh. You noticed, too?

147
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,814
Do you think something triggered it?

148
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,276
Who knows? The Kengan Association
is full of ambitious people.

149
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,820
Ambitious people?

150
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,781
-Are you talking about yourself?
-You're as sexy as ever.

151
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,784
-Huh. Ohma Tokita.
-Wow! He's hot!

152
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,495
Huh? Do I know you?

153
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,832
You're even more handsome close up.

154
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,168
I can see why our fighter,
Kiryu, is chasing after you.

155
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,841
Setsuna Kiryu. Where is that asshole?

156
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,593
Oh no! Ms. Soryuin!

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,972
Don't lose your cool, boy.
Are you trying to hit on me?

158
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,474
What are you doing, Tokita?

159
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:47,647
I don't know what kind of history
you guys have, but I can tell you this.

160
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,985
He is extraordinarily strong.

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,656
If you want to fight him, you should
prepare yourself to some extent.

162
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,659
SETSUNA KIRYU
FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

163
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,161
What the hell are you?

164
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:06,666
Blood splatter from the blow you struck
fell on him and defiled his body.

165
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,336
You should die.

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,093
Yes, companies are allowed to change

167
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,596
the fighter they have
chosen to represent them.

168
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,555
What?

169
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,015
RYO HIMURO
GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

170
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,933
Are you kidding me right now, Kaneda?

171
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,729
Oh, no. That's not my intention at all.

172
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,982
So, I'll ask you one more time,
Mr. Himuro.

173
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,279
Will you allow me
to represent you instead?

174
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,581
You want to be our fighter?

175
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,792
What's wrong with you, Kaneda?

176
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,337
-It's too late to switch--
-No, it's not.

177
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:58,092
The chairman mentioned two things
in his speech which caught my attention.

178
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,348
The first thing was that the fighters are
only officially registered upon arrival.

179
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,018
To put it another way,

180
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,981
until we arrive at our destination,
you are allowed to change your fighters.

181
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,566
That can't be true.

182
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,528
Don't you remember he also said private
battles weren't allowed on the ship?

183
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,535
What he actually said was that battles
between kengan fighters are forbidden.

184
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,788
That brings me to the second thing.

185
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,958
Battles with outsiders are not prohibited.

186
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,878
If you want proof of that,
look over there.

187
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,506
Those Guards are watching
me organize a private battle

188
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,550
yet they're making
no attempt to try to stop me.

189
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh my God.

190
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,307
I didn't think there could be a loophole
like this in the passenger-on-board rule.

191
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,560
Hey, Himuro!

192
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,606
Don't worry, Mr. Ohya.
I won't harm your friend.

193
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,401
I'll get this done in no time.

194
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,153
You're scaring me!

195
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,699
He's not bluffing, he's perfectly serious.

196
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,119
All right, then. Let's get started.

197
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:10,581
The winner will represent Ginokuniya
Bookshop. Is that okay with you?

198
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,043
It's not like I have
anything against you or--

199
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,840
Don't be vain.

200
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,759
You are no match for me.

201
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,972
He's fast and he's a southpaw.

202
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,473
I'll give you one minute.

203
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,685
If you can withstand my attacks
for one minute,

204
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,687
you can be their fighter.

205
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,940
That's very kind of you.

206
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,946
I'm not going to pull any punches.
You should prepare yourself.

207
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,240
It's okay. This isn't a problem.

208
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,494
I just need to watch out for his left fist
while I analyze his--

209
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,206
That was a vertical fist!

210
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,591
No, I was wrong. He's not a southpaw.

211
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,343
I see.

212
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,178
Mr. Himuro,

213
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,765
you practice Jeet Kune Do, don't you?

214
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,853
Jeet Kune Do is a modern martial art
based on Chinese Kung Fu

215
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,106
which has ambiguous fighting tactics.

216
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,193
It uses a stance
with the dominant arm and leg forward

217
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,195
and unique trapping techniques.

218
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,031
It allows all kinds of forbidden moves,
such as poking eyes,

219
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,158
attacking the groin and kicking joints.

220
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,660
The battles are kept brief and short.

221
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,539
The average match lasts
for a mere six seconds.

222
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
It's my balance.

223
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,004
He worked that out by observing
the position of my center of gravity.

224
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,924
You have a keen eye.

225
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,343
Good luck with that.

226
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,013
Feel free to surrender
as soon as you've had enough.

227
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,733
Is he just going to defend himself
for the whole minute?

228
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,861
Don't underestimate me.
Die, sucker!

229
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,285
Whoa, Himuro. Don't take it too far.

230
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,838
He got him right in the ribs!

231
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,926
I hope you get it now, Kaneda.

232
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,889
Kengan matches are no game.
So don't joke around.

233
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,394
Is he serious?
Does he still think he can win?

234
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,693
Kaneda hit Himuro.

235
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,823
It looks like I scored a bull's eye.

236
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,160
What the hell?
How did he manage to hit me?

237
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,997
How was that? I'm not that bad, am I?

238
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,249
You freaking newbie.

239
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,711
You're getting too cocky.
Playtime's over.

240
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,345
I'm going to ask you again.

241
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,767
Will you allow me to represent
Ginokuniya Bookshop instead?

242
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:21,105
What's happening?
How did he beat me?

243
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,442
I'm so tired.
Why don't we have a little break?

244
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,365
Himuro.

245
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,743
He's got serious.

246
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,995
I admit it.

247
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,955
You're strong.

248
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,417
What a murderous expression on his face.

249
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,841
What is the most powerful weapon
in Jeet Kune Do?

250
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,928
Is it breaking a joint?
Or kicking the groin?

251
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,472
No. The answer is...

252
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,768
the combination
of the fastest and the shortest.

253
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,772
The average punch velocity
of a middleweight boxer

254
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,357
is ten meters per second.

255
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:10,196
Himuro's punch velocity however,
is an outstanding 15 meters per second.

256
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,908
Furthermore, he can shift
to the offensive in an instant

257
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,077
while still blocking
his opponent's attacks.

258
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:22,291
It makes the opponent experience
his punches faster than they actually are.

259
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,880
Eye jab? He's trying to kill me!

260
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,383
That's enough, Himuro!
Kaneda can't take anymore.

261
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,888
It's over now.

262
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,769
Perfect! That felt amazing.
But he did make it difficult...

263
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,231
What?

264
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,484
Thank you, Mr. Himuro.

265
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,987
Now I'm the winner.

266
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,535
He broke his arm!

267
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,918
My timing was perfect. How?

268
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,379
Wow. That must hurt a lot.

269
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,426
So, what do you say?
Do you want to continue?

270
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,680
Kaneda, I'm going to kill you!

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,557
You can stop now, Himuro!

272
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,269
Even you can't fight with only one arm.

273
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,065
He hit his broken arm!

274
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,903
Suddenly, Himuro's blows
stopped landing on Kaneda.

275
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,949
What kind of trick is Kaneda using?

276
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,869
What the hell was that?

277
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,788
Kaneda dodged Himuro's kick
faster than he could deliver it?

278
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,790
No way!

279
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,797
Blow to the liver in one second.
One and a half steps back.

280
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,008
And... he missed it.

281
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:59,013
I can't believe that Kaneda can actually
predict Himuro's every move.

282
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,390
Is that even possible?

283
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,435
Can we finish this now?

284
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,148
It took me a while,
but I can read your every move now.

285
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,109
You've already been checkmated.

286
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,779
It's not cool to go on struggling in vain.

287
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,657
Why don't you just concede?

288
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,201
Shut up!

289
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,995
Of course, it had to end like this.

290
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,875
The Kujin Style...

291
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,629
Falling Bucket.

292
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,432
Kaneda.

293
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,853
You should have had
enough by now, Mr. Himuro.

294
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,023
Just stay lying there.

295
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,276
Stop, Kaneda! That's enough!

296
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,157
Mr. Himuro. You're incredible.

297
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,620
I admire your tenacity
and determination to triumph.

298
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,958
However, this is checkmate.

299
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,965
Himuro was the strongest fighter
our company has ever had.

300
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:21,846
But he still lost... to this unknown man.

301
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,557
So what?

302
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,436
Being strong is absolute
and the only truth.

303
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,606
Kaneda, why don't you become our fighter?

304
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,736
RYO HIMURO
FIGHTER, GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

305
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,988
SUEKICHI KANEDA
FIGHTER, GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

306
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,411
Hey, Tokita. I've been looking for you.

307
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,705
I'm digesting my food.

308
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,249
People are holding
so many parties on this ship.

309
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,586
Free food and drink is awesome.

310
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,212
By the way, did you hear?

311
00:20:56,046 --> 00:21:00,009
Ginokuniya's fighter, Himuro,
was defeated by a stranger.

312
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,928
Who is this Kaneda guy?

313
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,308
Actually, should we
be worried about ourselves?

314
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,438
It turns out battles are allowed as long
as they're not between kengan fighters.

315
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,606
Who cares?

316
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,983
What? You should, Tokita.

317
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:21,447
It means we run the risk
of being attacked by somebody.

318
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,994
Thank you for coming.

319
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,871
TAKESHI WAKATSUKI
FIGHTER, FURUMI PHARMA

320
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,830
You'd better mean it.

321
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,791
COSMO IMAI
FIGHTER, NISHIHONJI SECURITY SERVICES

322
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,503
-I was in the middle of having dinner.
-Could you stop eating for a moment?

323
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,922
Strange. What is it?

324
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,221
The rules of this tournament allow
for collusion, bribery and intimidation.

325
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,850
I don't see how those
rules benefit the chairman.

326
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,354
So, you're wondering why
he has those rules?

327
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:58,150
Who's behind all this?
And who can we trust?

328
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,778
Misjudging this could cost us our lives.

329
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,157
Here they come already.

330
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,870
Look. They're kengan fighters.

331
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,374
Let's crush them and take their spots.

332
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,875
MISFORTUNE

333
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,337
Well, I guess my plan to talk to you
covertly has worked against me.

334
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:23,300
No. This is perfect.
I was getting bored of this voyage.

335
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:28,055
Whoa. Don't you have any sense of danger?

336
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,476
Well, looks like it's time
for a little workout.

337
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,020
Let's do this.

338
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,946
PREVIEW

339
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,199
This is the battlefield
of the tournament, Ganryu Island.

340
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:14,787
Men, women, geniuses, gods and demons.

341
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,163
The time has come.

342
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,583
Spin the roulette wheel of fate.
Next episode: "The Night Before"

1
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:17,309
As of today, as chairman
of the Kengan Association...

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,854
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:26,944
...I hereby declare the Kengan
Life-or-Death Tournament open.

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,739
METSUDO KATAHARA
GOVERNOR OF DAINIPPON BANK

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,993
Anyone who desires the position
of chairman of the association is welcome.

6
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,496
Enter your strongest fighter!

7
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:42,668
This declaration by Metsudo Katahara,
the chairman of the Kengan Association,

8
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,297
was earth-shattering
to those who desired power.

9
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,969
FIGHTERS WRIGGLE IN THE DARK!

10
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,022
REUNITED

11
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,443
NOGI GROUP HEADQUARTERS

12
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,778
Oh no! Oh no!

13
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,279
KAZUO YAMASHITA
NOGI PUBLICATIONS

14
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,033
Ohma, what are you doing to Mr. Nogi?

15
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:42,079
Old man. What did you just say?

16
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,539
HIDEKI NOGI
CHAIRMAN, NOGI GROUP

17
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,667
I'll say it as many times as you want,
Ohma Tokita.

18
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,461
For the next Kengan
Life-or-Death Tournament,

19
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,800
I won't have you fight
on behalf of our company.

20
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,762
I guess you want me
to end your life here, huh?

21
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,432
Hold on a second.
Please, calm down a little.

22
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,643
KAEDE AKIYAMA,
CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY, NOGI GROUP

23
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,103
What has changed Mr. Nogi's mind?

24
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,523
He tested Ohma's abilities
in previous kengan matches

25
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,859
to be sure he was good
enough to fight for us.

26
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,487
Oh?

27
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,781
Are you in the middle of something?

28
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,241
It's you!

29
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,411
Tokita, let me introduce you.

30
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,747
This is Sen Hatsumi,

31
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,293
Nogi Group's chosen fighter
for the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament.

32
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,337
SEN HATSUMI
FIGHTER, NOGI GROUP

33
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,131
Hey, reject. Good to meet you.

34
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,300
He's going to represent us?

35
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:41,972
This is a disgraceful sight, Pop.
Are you in trouble?

36
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,892
Can't you see? Just help me, you idiot.

37
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,561
You heard him.

38
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,398
Mind if I resort to violence, reject?

39
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:56,194
Do you think that would work against me?

40
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes, I do.

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,040
You shouldn't raise
your hand to your employer.

42
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,293
Actually, before that,

43
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,296
you should take
better care of your broken arm.

44
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,590
What are you, a doctor?

45
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,801
Not just your right arm, your whole body.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,306
All that damage you've taken
is pretty serious.

47
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,642
You think you can fight in that condition?

48
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,519
Dream on, brat.

49
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,648
He's dodging all Ohma's blows.

50
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,359
He has 39 wins and 15 losses.

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,324
That's Sen Hatsumi's kengan match record.

52
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,118
Fifteen losses? Isn't that kind of a lot?

53
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,830
There's no doubt that
his skills are first-rate,

54
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,082
but he has some behavioral problems.

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,626
His loss breakdown is--

56
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,005
I skipped four, forgot about two,
and missed nine because I overslept.

57
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,299
That adds up to 15 losses.

58
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,093
-Hey!
-You've made me happy, Kaede.

59
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,888
I didn't know you cared
about me that much.

60
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,766
Do you have any idea
how much those losses cost Nogi Group?

61
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,393
Do you want to go out
for dinner with me later?

62
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,770
No, I don't!

63
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,026
Oops. Did I go too far?

64
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,988
Seems like I flicked a switch in him.

65
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,619
That sound is exactly the same as the one
I heard in the match with Sekibayashi.

66
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,207
Okay, you started this.
No hard feelings, even if you die.

67
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:43,593
You blocked me. Your speed has greatly
increased since you changed to that form.

68
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,680
What's the trick?
Some kind of transformation?

69
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,851
Whatever.
I'm pretty confident about my speed, too.

70
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,188
Do you want to see
if you're faster than me?

71
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,071
He really is fast. But...

72
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,126
You bent the flow of my power.

73
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,170
You use the Niko Style, don't you?

74
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,215
Did you say Niko Style?

75
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,467
That's strange.

76
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,722
I heard the Niko Style wasn't passed
down to the second generation.

77
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,145
Don't you ever talk about Niko again!

78
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,773
Oh. Did that hit a nerve?

79
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,903
You're far too cocky, you little brat.

80
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,404
That's enough.

81
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,405
Oh, God!

82
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,032
Ohma.

83
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,117
This is not open to discussion.

84
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,997
Sen Hatsumi will represent
Nogi Group at the tournament.

85
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,751
Yeah? Will he?

86
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,754
-Then, I'll kill--
-However...

87
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:06,801
there's nothing stopping you winning
a spot in the tournament yourself.

88
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,179
What?

89
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,558
Don't you understand?

90
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:18,521
You'll need a certain individual
to make this plan work, though.

91
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,943
-Yamashita, come here.
-Me? Yes, sir.

92
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,199
Why don't you become a member
of the Kengan Association?

93
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,500
What are you talking about, Mr. Nogi?

94
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,252
There's no way he can become a member.

95
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,297
You still have a lot to learn, Akiyama.

96
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,759
There are always loopholes
to be found in business.

97
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,429
Being a member of the Kengan Association

98
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,974
confirms that you are
a first-rate merchant.

99
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:59,354
This is the reason countless people
are dying to become members.

100
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,522
FIST

101
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,442
There are also people who pretend to have
the authority of the Kengan Association

102
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,655
and conduct unofficial matches
offering the chance to win membership.

103
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,409
What they want is money,
paid as a "challenge fee."

104
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,119
Unofficial matches?

105
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,415
The referees are from
the official Kengan Association.

106
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,794
I guess you could call them
"kengan challenge matches."

107
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,589
The challenge fee is
a hundred million yen.

108
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:30,010
-A hundred--
-Don't worry.

109
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,179
I happen to have that
exact amount to hand today.

110
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,223
Here. A hundred million yen.

111
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,684
How do you have that?

112
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,061
What do you say, Yamashita?

113
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,524
This is the only way Ohma
can fight in the tournament.

114
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,403
Wait. Why am I being forced to make
such a crazy decision?

115
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,031
How did this happen?
This whole situation is messed up.

116
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,326
I'm just an ordinary businessman.
How could I do such a thing?

117
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,539
I need to calm down. Take a deep breath.

118
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,544
I need to stand my ground
and say no without offending him.

119
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,050
Well, I appreciate your offer, but...

120
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:15,805
Cool. We'll enter
these unofficial matches.

121
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,309
Why are you answering for me?

122
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,313
Hey. I'm going to settle things
between us at the tournament.

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,565
All right. Whatever you say.

124
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,568
Don't they understand that
I haven't agreed yet?

125
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,696
-Great decision.
-I admire your courage.

126
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,824
Why are they taking this as a yes from me?

127
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,079
This is bad. I have to get out
of this before it's too late.

128
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,875
Listen to me, Ohma.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but...

129
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,878
Let's do this, Kazuo Yamashita.

130
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,468
Yes. Let's do our best.

131
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,553
It's been officially confirmed.

132
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:00,809
Kazuo Yamashita will enter
the unofficial kengan match.

133
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,944
UNDERGROUND DISCHARGE TUNNEL
(40 METERS BELOW GROUND)

134
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,905
This is the metropolitan area outer
underground discharge tunnel.

135
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,408
Tonight, fighters will get a chance to
win membership of the Kengan Association,

136
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,288
by taking part in unofficial fights.

137
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,542
Ladies and gentlemen,

138
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:31,464
thank you for coming
all the way down here to join us tonight.

139
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,057
Let me now introduce the fighters.

140
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:46,938
This fighter holds membership
of the Kengan Association.

141
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,567
Ushitami Food Service's
affiliated fighter...

142
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,070
MASAYASU YOKOTA
FIGHTER, USHITAMI FOOD SERVICE

143
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,405
...Masayasu Yokota.

144
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,826
The challenger is Yamashita Corporation's
affiliated fighter,

145
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,661
Ohma Tokita.

146
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,080
OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

147
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,876
-Isn't that guy with Nogi?
-He knocked Sekibayashi down.

148
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,962
-He's the rookie everyone's talking about.
-Has he transferred already?

149
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,256
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

150
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,675
-Yamashita Corporation?
-Their president looks really pale.

151
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,053
How did I get myself into this?

152
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,181
A company?

153
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,433
Yes, your company.

154
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:28,062
The Kengan Association is an organization
of business managers and finance people.

155
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,231
So, to become a member of the association,

156
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,943
you need to be a company manager,
it's just a formality.

157
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,448
The name of the company
and its line of work don't really matter.

158
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,701
How about a simple name,
such as "Yamashita Corporation"?

159
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,079
He's making bad life decisions
on my behalf.

160
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,625
All that's left to do now
is to apply for the match.

161
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:55,798
The next matches will be held
in two days, eight days and 12 days’ time.

162
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,551
There's no going back now.

163
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,765
So, the date. Which one would be better?

164
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,517
-I'll fight in two days, obviously.
-Huh?

165
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,436
Hold on, Ohma.

166
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,272
-You can't fight with your wounded--
-Kazuo Yamashita.

167
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,484
Do you think they will have healed
in ten days or even in 12?

168
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,903
Well, you have a point, but...

169
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,949
I'm going to be fit by the time
the Life-or-Death Tournament is held,

170
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,700
totally fit, for sure.

171
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,621
I will make it to the tournament.

172
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,624
And that's where I will beat you.

173
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,795
All right. We've confirmed that
you've paid the fee.

174
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,214
We wish you luck.

175
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,594
I'll be one hundred million yen in debt
whether we win or not.

176
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,721
MIKIO NABE
PRESIDENT, USHITAMI FOOD SERVICE

177
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,308
Yokota, you're known as
the "Kingpin Brawler of Gadokan Karate."

178
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,061
-I bet you'll finish him in no time.
-Sure.

179
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:56,067
Kengan membership is such a great way
to attract rich suckers.

180
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,570
I love making money.

181
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,573
Are you ready? Set!

182
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,956
Fight!

183
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,585
Huh?

184
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:24,512
The winner is Ohma Tokita!

185
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,810
We've lost our membership
of the Kengan Association.

186
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,858
-Kazuo Yamashita.
-Yes?

187
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,860
We won.

188
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,989
That's... awesome!

189
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,703
I can trust this man with my life.

190
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,382
Is this the membership certificate?
It's very plain.

191
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
What's important is its value.

192
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,720
Why?

193
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,638
Why is he there?

194
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,187
I didn't expect to see
him again like this.

195
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,315
How many years has it been...

196
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,067
KENZO YAMASHITA
KAZUO'S OLDEST SON

197
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,526
...since I last saw his face?

198
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,821
You look a lot older, Dad.

199
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,702
UNDER MOUNT INC

200
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,123
MASAHIKO OHTA
PRESIDENT, UNDER MOUNT INC

201
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,725
Hello?

202
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:41,297
Oh! Hello, boss. How are you, sir?

203
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,468
Mr. Ohta, I've told you so many times
that you're the one who's president.

204
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,054
KENZO'S ROOM IN YAMASHITA'S HOUSE
USED AS UNDER MOUNT INC HQ

205
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,057
-I'm happy hiding behind you.
-Well, you may think that way,

206
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,185
but if it hadn't been for you,
the company couldn't have come this far.

207
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,397
You're the one working behind the scenes.

208
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,732
Putting that aside,

209
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,528
thank you for recording the match
the other day.

210
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,613
No problem at all.

211
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,659
With a certain unexpected discovery,
we've now collected enough data.

212
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,246
-Does that mean...
-Yes.

213
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,626
We will enter
the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament

214
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,257
after welcoming one fighter
from the Kure Family.

215
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,302
Kure?

216
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,512
KURE FAMILY

217
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,305
What is the Kure Family?

218
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,102
They appear wherever
conflict is happening.

219
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,479
Providing the money
and conditions are right,

220
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,982
they won't hesitate to kill
their previous employers.

221
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,152
They are, so to speak, mercenaries.

222
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:51,033
We have decided to fight for
Under Mount Inc in the tournament.

223
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:56,539
I wonder which member of our family
we should send to the tournament?

224
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,806
I don't need to step out of this house.

225
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,184
I can stay in the shadows...

226
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,188
and seize this country.

227
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,319
Hey, Kazu! It's me, Ken.

228
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,364
Are you free now?
Let's go for a drink together.

229
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,950
-See you soon, Kazu.
-Wait.

230
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,954
That drunk man at the match called me.

231
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,040
As I couldn't turn it down,
I found myself here.

232
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,084
But what kind of man drinks
at this high-class hotel?

233
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,252
FIVE STAR HOTEL, TOKYO

234
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,549
Whatever it was that brought us together,

235
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,844
I wanted to give you a pep talk,
now that we're friends.

236
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,514
Friends? A pep talk?

237
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,559
I'm surprised you've become
a member of the Kengan Association.

238
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,019
How did you find out about that?

239
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,021
The whole Kengan Association
is talking about it.

240
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,689
SKY BAR LOUNGE,
UPPER FLOOR OF THE HOTEL

241
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,441
They're saying that
some mysterious company

242
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,361
called the Yamashita Corporation
is going to join the kengan tournament.

243
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,695
Are they?

244
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,448
So, did Mr. Nogi pay
the entry fee of five billion yen

245
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,742
for you to pay back later?

246
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,204
Five... what?

247
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,040
He set me up!

248
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,544
He didn't say anything about that.

249
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,006
You can pay it off
easily enough if you win.

250
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,758
That son of a bitch.

251
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,344
-Damn it!
-Wow.

252
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,682
I'll do it. I just need to win, right?

253
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:42,853
I will make that Nogi bastard
regret the day he underestimated me!

254
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,940
Wow. Look at you, Kazu.

255
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,901
I've made up my mind.

256
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,572
From now on,
as the president of Yamashita Corporation,

257
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,740
I'll handle the Kengan
Life-or-Death Tournament.

258
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,869
Kazuo Yamashita of Nogi Publications
dies today!

259
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,246
That's the spirit!

260
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,707
Screw the Nogi Group!

261
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,840
There's something I wanted to
tell you tonight, Kazu.

262
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,260
What is it, Ken?

263
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:19,307
My company is actually participating in
the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament too.

264
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,559
-Right?
-Yes.

265
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,187
This is our fighter, Ryo Himuro.

266
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,440
RYO HIMURO
FIGHTER, GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

267
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:32,320
He's only fought four kengan matches
but he's a really good fighter.

268
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,158
Really?
And which company are you talking about?

269
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,286
It's a little bookstore called Ginokuniya.

270
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,540
You named it after
the famous Ginokuniya Bookshop?

271
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,501
We are the Ginokuniya.

272
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,547
-You are?
-We are.

273
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,798
Oh.

274
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,136
You're like the famous shogun
who patrolled the city in disguise.

275
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,306
Oh, Kazu. That's very flattering.

276
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,266
KEN OHYA
CHAIRMAN, GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP

277
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,894
I hate to say this to you,
but the championship will be ours.

278
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:10,399
That's funny.
Somehow I feel like I saw this coming.

279
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,943
I'm not going to lose, Ken.

280
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,863
That's just what I want, Kazu.

281
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,913
ABANDONED MINE, TOKYO

282
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,684
Good. I've completely recovered.

283
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,769
All I need to do is win.

284
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,438
I've arrived...

285
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,400
on the battlefield.

286
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,243
These last ten years have felt
like a long time.

287
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,203
NIKO TOKITA
OHMA'S MASTER OF NIKO STYLE

288
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,413
A very long time.

289
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,168
Niko.

290
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,881
Hi. Long time no see.

291
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,676
Huh?

292
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,886
Who the hell are you?

293
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,807
GENZAN TAIRA
NIKO'S ENEMY, KOEI STYLE

294
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,481
-Now you remember me.
-What are you doing here?

295
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,275
I let him get close.

296
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,944
Oh, I love it.

297
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,865
You've beefed up beautifully
since I last saw you.

298
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,074
You--

299
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,828
I have one thing to tell you.

300
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,788
You've been chasing...

301
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,125
my master for the past ten years
in order to get your revenge.

302
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,295
But I killed him.

303
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,757
How does it feel?

304
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,510
The man who killed your master,
Niko Tokita,

305
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,221
is already dead.

306
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,766
You must be so mad.

307
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,019
Take it all out on me,
the man who stole your revenge.

308
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,189
Come on. Don't be shy.

309
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,817
Go ahead and kill me
just like my master killed Niko Tokita.

310
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,654
I'll see you again someday.

311
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,117
I hope the next time
we see each other...

312
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,830
we'll be enemies.

313
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,542
Niko.

314
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,588
Now, strike me with your anger.

315
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,633
The man who ruined your revenge
is right in front of you.

316
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,760
Don't get the wrong idea.

317
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,471
What did you say?

318
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,683
Revenge?
Did you think that's what I wanted?

319
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,938
Your master and Niko only died
because they were weak.

320
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,482
But I am stronger than Niko was.

321
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:01,695
The reason I was going after
your master was to prove that.

322
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:08,202
I can't stand those fools who act like
they're the strongest of all of us.

323
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,705
I'm going to crush
every one of those bastards...

324
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,501
and show them that I'm the strongest!

325
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,712
Luckily, there's a stage set up

326
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:22,132
for misguided dudes
who think they're the strongest.

327
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,594
I'm going to smash you
at that tournament,

328
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,181
along with all of those other
self-proclaimed "strongest" fighters.

329
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,060
Look forward to it, you freak.

330
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,610
You're right. You're right!

331
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,363
We should choose the best possible stage
on which to kill each other.

332
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:49,910
Seek for love, fight for love,
and kill each other for love.

333
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,916
And then, in despair of losing you,

334
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,752
I will shoot my load.

335
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,380
Man, you're too much to handle.

336
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,009
Now that we have a plan,
I should get going.

337
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,262
I'll see you at the tournament.

338
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:14,059
Tell me one thing before you go.
What's your name?

339
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,645
Setsuna.

340
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,858
SETSUNA KIRYU
FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

341
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,401
I'm Setsuna Kiryu. Don't forget.

342
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,905
It's the name of your enemy.

343
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,996
Setsuna Kiryu, huh?

344
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,003
Got it.

345
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,971
Setsuna Kiryu!
I'm going to crush you!

346
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,226
With emotions running high,

347
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:03,025
the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament
is about to begin.

348
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,244
PREVIEW

349
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,204
Is it a wish? Or an ambition?

350
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,207
The kengan fighters are
at the mercy of the ship of death.

351
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,586
Show your powers.
Fight your own way.

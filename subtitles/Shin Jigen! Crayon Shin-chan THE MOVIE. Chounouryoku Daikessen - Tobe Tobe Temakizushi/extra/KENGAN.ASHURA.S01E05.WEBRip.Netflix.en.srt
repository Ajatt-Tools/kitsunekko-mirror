00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,433
Hey, did you hear that
Mr. Yamashita is taking a vacation?

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,436
-And for ten days in a row.
-Seriously?

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,564
I heard he's working on a secret mission
and accompanying the chairman.

5
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,693
So cool! I didn't know
he was such a great businessman.

How, how could you, Yamashita?

9
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,077
And so...

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,580
I'll be away on a business trip
for ten days.

11
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,041
KAZUO YAMASHITA
PRESIDENT, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,210
I've left you some money
on the dining table.

13
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,503
Call me if you need my help.

14

KENZO YAMASHITA, KAZUO'S OLDEST SON
AND THE REAL PRESIDENT OF UNDER MOUNT INC

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,300
I'm off. Take care, Kenzo.

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,597
The Life-or-Death Tournament
is finally about to start.

17
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:00,978
Let the battle to become
ruler of the nation commence.

18
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,144
Today is the first day of
the Kengan Life-or-Death Tournament.

00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:05,732
DAY ONE
KENGAN LIFE-OR-DEATH TOURNAMENT

20
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,201
So many people!

21
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,753
One hundred and fifty-one fighters...

22
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,738
KAEDE AKIYAMA,
CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARY, NOGI GROUP

23
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:12,686
...have entered.

OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

FIGHTER

28
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,998
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:23,058
It's time for boarding.

THE KENGAN, CRUISE SHIP

33
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,468
...to board the Kengan cruise ship.

34
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,014
Look at how gorgeous it is!

35
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,142
It's one of the biggest
luxury cruise ships in the world.

36
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,852
GEN SHIKANO,
JUN SEKIBAYASHI

37
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,978
A ship? Never tried one.

38
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,187
SHION SORYUIN,
SETSUNA KIRYU

39
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,064
But, um...

40
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:51,653
Excuse me, but we don't
have a letter of invitation.

41
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:56,700
If you don't have an invitation,
please board the other ship.

42
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,202
Seriously?

43
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,455
THE DEATH
CARGO SHIP

44
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,958
-That worn-out ship is for us?
-What are they thinking?

45
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,752
THE DEATH

46
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,920
I will definitely get seasick on it.

47
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,974
"BRAWL"

48
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,185
Jeez!

49
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,981
All I can say is "jeez."

50
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,484
I feel nervous,
being in a place like this.

51
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,777
What's going to happen next?

52
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,780
I'm feeling rather relaxed here.

53
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,867
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,996
We ask that the fighters go
through that door into the other room.

55
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,003
Would the rest of you
please proceed upstairs?

56
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,507
Does that mean we're going
to be separated from Ohma?

57
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,176
It seems so.

58
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,178
See you, Kazuo Yamashita.

59
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,432
-Wait! You're leaving us so soon?
-Let's go upstairs.

60
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,321
Well, well... I can see
some fools in here

61
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,032
mistakenly believe themselves
to be the strongest.

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,290
Wow, what a surprise! Look at that!

63
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,460
Please, stop acting like a child,
Mr. Yamashita.

64
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,215
Oh, there's Ohma! He's seen us!

65
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,677
What? Something to drink?

66
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,973
Okay, okay. I have his bag here.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,893
If it's just a drink, I'll take it to him.

68
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,480
-Don't forget, you're a president for now.
-"For now"?

69
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,942
-Please, try to be dignified.
-Yes.

70
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:24,825
Why are they keeping the employers
and the fighters in different rooms?

71
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,083
-Thanks.
-Is there anything else?

72
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,502
Well, see you later.

73
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,296
Wait, Kaede.

74
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,883
What do you think about this situation?

75
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,803
What do you mean?

76
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:50,934
I mean exactly what I said.
Something is obviously off...

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,479
It's like some kind of special show.

78
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,316
I can't wait to see
what's going to happen.

79
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,695
Wait, don't tell me...

80
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,533
-The Death has departed.
-All right, start it.

81
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,954
What just happened?

82
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,210
Employers and fighters,
thank you for waiting.

83
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,422
Our ship has set sail, as planned.

84
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,717
I'd also like to take this
opportunity to announce

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,888
that the preliminary match of
the Life-or-Death Tournament has begun.

86
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,639
The preliminary match?

87
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,476
-Do we have to do this?
-I didn't know that.

88
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,938
One hundred and fifty-one participants
have been entered into this tournament.

89
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:41,568
Twenty eight out of the 151 participants
have an invitation from Chairman Katahara,

90
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,862
and are seeded to fight in the finals.

91
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,990
Those are the guys who
boarded the other ship.

92
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,868
Only five more participants
can make it to the finals.

93
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,914
We would like to challenge
everyone here to a battle royal.

94
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,875
You have until dawn.

95
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,838
Excuse me, I'm not supposed to be in here!
I'm not a fighter!

96
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:07,969
From now on, you are prohibited from
contacting your fighter for any reason.

97
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:13,224
Please enjoy watching the battle royal
from the viewing area above the field.

98
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:19,481
I can't believe this!
Ms. Akiyama is in danger!

99
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,486
You can also enjoy a game on the deck
courtesy of our bookmaker.

100
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,490
Any of you who are confident about
the outcome are welcome to place a bet.

101
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,994
I guess we'll be trapped in this room
until the preliminary match is over.

102
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,205
That includes you.

103
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,960
You have no choice.
Be careful not to get in my way.

104
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,629
Are you an idiot?

105
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,714
-What the...
-Besides,

106
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,134
it's your fault that I'm trapped in here!

107
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,638
Ohma, of course you are responsible!

108
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,683
You must win this, okay?

109
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,395
Protect me at all costs
until you win this battle.

110
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,148
Well, you've got some guts.

111
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,402
Hey, you brought a woman with you?
That's some nerve!

112
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,904
The match is already on!

113
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,616
-Kaede Akiyama.
-Address me in a more polite manner.

114
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,494
-Keep well back.
-Don't use my full name.

115
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,871
-Laid-back, aren't you?
-I'll kill you!

116
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,962
NIKO STYLE - REDIRECTION KATA:
WEEPING WILLOW

117
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,214
What's happening?

118
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,592
The flow of power is bent.

119
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,802
Yes!

120
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,512
All right.

121
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,057
-Keep behind me, Your Majesty.
-Sure.

122
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,600
Did you see that?

123
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,228
He's pretty strong. Let's smash him first.

124
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,148
It'll be harder for each of us
if he survives this round.

125
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,691
Let's crush him as a group.

126
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,568
Tokita!

127
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,576
-Lihito.
-He entered the tournament too?

128
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,995
LIHITO
FIGHTER, SH FROZEN STORAGE

129
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,122
-I've missed you, Tokita.
-That's Lihito.

130
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,958
-Lihito the Ripper!
-Hey, Lihito.

131
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,586
Don't say you've forgotten me.

132
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm going to get back
at you for this scar.

133
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,092
Who are you, jerk? Go away.

134
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,846
THE RAZOR'S EDGE, TEN RIPPING FINGERS

135
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,393
He ripped close up.
He's become more skillful.

136
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,521
I've longed to see you, Tokita.

137
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,649
I've trained relentlessly
for this moment...

138
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,570
-You're Nogi Group's...
-Hi.

139
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,657
What are you doing here? Um...

140
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,453
I'm Kaede Akiyama.
I didn't choose to be here.

141
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,332
I brought water to Ohma, and now
here I am, having to endure all this.

142
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,292
Are you listening?

143
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,671
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-I knew you weren't listening.

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,218
Okay, I think I understand
your situation, Tokita.

145
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,762
Look, they're targeting you too.

146
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,683
Don't worry, baby. I'll be your bodyguard!

147
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,227
No, thank you.

148
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,271
She doesn't need you.
Can I get started?

149
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:11,319
-Don't hold back for my sake.
-You wanted to beat me up, didn't you?

150
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,197
Right. I'll get my revenge
on you, don't worry.

151
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,952
But not now. I want you
to advance to the finals.

152
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,662
What do you mean?

153
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:25,166
Stay back, Kaede.
There's going to be bloodshed.

154
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,417
Listen to me.

155
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,795
Don't screw around with us!

156
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,131
Guys! Let's kill these rats!

157
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,799
You can't do that.

158
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,176
Never!

159
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,929
They're unrivaled.

160
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,974
Those two are incredible.

161
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,269
That's it! That's my Ohma!

162
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,520
What's that?

163
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,439
Stay away!

164
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,447
Who's that?

165
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,331
JERRY TYSON
FIGHTER, 22ND CENTURY FAX

166
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:10,044
Who's that weirdo?
Is he a fighter too, Kaede?

167
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,005
Maybe.

168
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,216
I don't have much information
about the other fighters.

169
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,721
I think we have a clown here.

170
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,309
You're my next prey, right?

171
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,703
JERRY TYSON, 22ND CENTURY FAX

TOTAL ASSETS ACQUIRED:
15 BILLION, 414 MILLION YEN

175
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,717
Ohma.

176
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,642
What is this trick?

177
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,104
He turned so quickly.

178
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,856
That's no human move.

179
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,942
I'm not going to stop, boy.

180
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,485
Not anytime,

181
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,779
not ever.

182
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,449
I'll keep chasing my enemies
until they're destroyed.

183
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,246
That's my Xing Yi Quan.

184
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:32,252
Jerry Tyson, 32 years old.
He's from Detroit, USA.

185
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,382
At the age of 17, he moved to China
because of his father's business.

186
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,345
What he discovered in this new land was...

187
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,181
Chinese kung fu.

188
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,599
CHINESE KUNG FU

189
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:51,312
Xing Yi Quan is one of its styles,
developed by mimicking or channeling

190
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,275
the forms and movements
of various animals.

191
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:00,071
However, a question arose in Jerry's mind.

192
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,658
Why animals?

193
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:08,746
Why did he have to mimic animals
when they're weaker than human beings?

194
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,041
Then he realized something.

195
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,503
He should really mimic humans...

196
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,551
No, their... weapons.

197
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,973
WEAPONS

198
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,099
Seven years later,

199
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,687
he created J-style Xing Yi Quan,
mimicking modern weapons.

200
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,441
Its most powerful move is...

201
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,277
Take this Scud Missile!

202
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,115
It's a powerful punch
which uses the entire mass of the body.

203
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,616
Idiot! Your side is open--

204
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,456
You're the idiot.
My kung fu style has no dead zone.

205
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:56,794
Attacking me when I'm moving this fast

206
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,298
is like running into a large truck.

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
Just give up.

208
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,054
Surrender yourself to my attack.

209
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,186
SORYU FORM: WEEPING WILLOW

210
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,150
He'll crash into the wall!

211
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,070
It's impossible to make
a sudden stop at this speed.

212
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,197
Just joking!

213
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,908
Did you think I'd let you
beat me that easily?

214
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,661
I won't let you enjoy a victory
that's sweeter than Mom's apple pie.

215
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,038
He repositioned himself!

216
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,459
Using the wall,
I've now got even more speed!

217
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,214
I'm now like...
a full metal jacket bullet!

218
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,718
A girl? Why is a non-fighter here?

219
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,430
Adjust my course? Brake?
No time left!

220
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,225
Use your brain, Jerry!

221
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,727
Think what to do!

222
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,938
Make a decision now!

223
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,401
I can't.

224
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,528
IMPOSSIBLE

225
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,987
Sorry, girl.

226
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,032
You won't die at least,
so please forgive me.

227
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,122
Oh?

228
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,333
Jeez... you should have screamed.

229
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,254
-Ohma!
-Saving you isn't rewarding.

230
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,549
But I like a strong-minded woman.

231
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,052
Please, don't joke around
in this situation.

232
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,472
How...

233
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,184
How was I the one to get blown out?

234
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,062
You don't get it?

235
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,024
I don't like to use this technique
because it's not cool.

236
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,403
Be careful.
Unlike the Redirection Kata,

237
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,489
I can't control my power when doing this.

238
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,535
TOKITA TOWN IN THE ILLEGAL ZONE OF JAPAN,
KNOWN AS "NAKA"

239
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,379
You still don't understand, do you?

240
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,216
Darn! Why won't it go in?

241
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,344
NIKO TOKITA,
OHMA'S MASTER OF NIKO STYLE

242
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,180
As I said, there's no point trying that.

243
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,807
You'd better not use your bare hands.

244
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,940
Oh, boy. I told you not to.

245
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,986
All right, now I'll explain to you
why your fists got hurt,

246
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,071
in a scientific way.

247
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,160
Question. If you had a kilo
of tofu and a kilo of iron,

248
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,289
which would be more painful
if they hit you at the same speed?

249
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,251
-I'll kill you!
-Listen to me.

250
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:47,882
What I'm trying to tell you is that
the harder object will be more painful.

251
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,259
Watch carefully, okay?

252
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,345
At the moment of impact,

253
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,015
tense your muscles.

254
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,730
It's quite something, right?

255
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,152
Tense every one of your muscles
the moment before impact,

256
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,113
then smash your steel-like body
into the object.

257
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,826
It's Indestructible, the basic technique
in the Adamantine Kata of the Niko style.

258
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,248
So, are you interested
in learning the Niko style now?

259
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,334
Not at all!

260
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,547
What the hell, I'll borrow...

261
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,800
your Niko style.

262
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,261
Are you going to challenge me head-on,

263
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,013
even when I'm heavier than you?

264
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,224
You're underestimating me.

265
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,727
Miracles don't happen twice.

266
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,779
With this technique specialized in attack,
I make sure to destroy the enemy.

267
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,703
NIKO STYLE - ADAMANTINE KATA:
INDESTRUCTIBLE

268
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,834
It's more than mimicking.

269
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,713
The boy himself is the weapon.

270
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,969
He won! That's my Ohma!

271
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,055
In some ways, you were quite strong.

272
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, I forgot to ask his name.

273
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,229
Darn it!

274
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,107
Why can't I take him down?

275
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,287
Damn you!

276
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,501
How can my submission hold be resisted
by a moron with only brute force?

277
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,298
A piece of cake!

278
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,385
Your primitive fighting style
hasn't changed.

279
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,640
You're also in this match, Sawada?

280
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,725
That's what I wanted to say.

281
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,563
You're such a poor loser.
I'll finish you off.

282
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,983
You're still such a big mouth.

283
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,403
Just bring it on, queer!

284
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,238
Queer... queer...

285
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,075
Don't...

286
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,411
Don't call me a queer, you brat!

287
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,999
Hey, Lihito! Don't get smart with me,
or I'm pretty sure I'll kill you.

288
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,543
Your hairstyle is disgusting, queer.

289
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,672
How dare you call me disgusting,
you little shit!

290
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,143
Is that true?

291
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,562
I'm quite certain, sir.

292
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,399
That's impossible. It's too soon.

293
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,820
The preliminary match
only started 15 minutes ago.

294
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,989
So, you guys are the ones

295
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,243
who'll be the sideshow
to my main act in the finals.

296
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,955
LIHITO

OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

301
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,223
I can't believe this.

302
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,225
Shoot!

303
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,147
I predicted all five
of them would qualify!

304
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,233
Darn it! If I had placed a bet
I could've earned big.

305
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:39,238
It would have helped me pay off my debt.

306
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:48,038
Ohma Tokita, my dear. I knew it.

307
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,208
You'd never lose to those fools.

308
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,419
I can't wait to kill you or
get lovingly killed by you.

SETSUNA KIRYU
FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,132
Ohma, sweetie!

311
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,595
Oh, dear.

312
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,140
I feel the mood is too tense
for a ceremony.

313
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,893
Look!

314
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:11,979
Chairman Katahara is here!

315
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,930
METSUDO KATAHARA, GOVERNOR OF DAINIPPON
BANK &amp; KENGAN ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN

316
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,900
Gentlemen!

317
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,652
Congratulations for making it through
the preliminary match.

318
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:24,742
Or maybe I should say, commiserations
for not losing in the preliminary match.

319
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,873
I originally planned to have a meeting
tomorrow morning, but...

320
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,668
Hmm... what's wrong?

321
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,295
Hassard.

322
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,536
EISAKU SUZUKI
PRESIDENT, BERCY PETROLEUM

323
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:39,799
Hassard, don't.

324
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,178
Mr. Katahara.
I have a question to ask you.

325
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,806
Oh, my... he's so gorgeous!

326
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:51,393
Why did you impose the preliminary
match only on us?

327
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,355
I want a good explanation from you.

328
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,235
What kind of factors were being considered
other than our abilities?

329
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,029
Don't flatter yourself, impudent brat!

330
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,365
What?

331
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:10,246
The top 28 in the company hierarchy
of the Kengan Association were exempted

332
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,416
from the first match because they
already have excellent results.

333
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,919
The company hierarchy?

334
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:22,758
We live in a world where merchants'
companies struggle for dominance.

335
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:28,013
It's hilarious that a tool like you
would argue over your merchant's head.

336
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,810
You should remember that
you fighters are just pawns.

337
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,729
Well, then I'll teach you...

338
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,148
how strong a pawn can be.

339
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,650
Hey, wait!

340
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,294
Rats!

341
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,884
God, the blood...

342
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,147
-Thank you, Yodoe.
-Anytime.

343
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,774
No, Hassard!

344
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,193
What was that?

345
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,154
He finished him in a flash.

346
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,616
Metsudo Katahara's private army,
known as the Guards,

347
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,994
are his shield while Fang is his pike.

348
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,540
It's an army of monsters
with extraordinary strength.

349
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,375
How silly!

350
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,962
He acted up without considering
his own ability.

351
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,300
Now the number of fighters is
down to 32 because of him.

352
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,887
But an even number is good.

353
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,265
Really?

354
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,311
What kind of monsters are going to
show up in the finals?

355
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:04,944
I have nothing but bad feelings
about this tournament.

356
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:36,952
PREVIEW

357
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,705
On The Kengan, a gorgeous ship,

358
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,916
schemes, conspiracies
and everything else is possible.

359
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,293
Who are you?

360
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:49,048
A dark horse predicts the divine move.
Next episode: "Pulling Strings"

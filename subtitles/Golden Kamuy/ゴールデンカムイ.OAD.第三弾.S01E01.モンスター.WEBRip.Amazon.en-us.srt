1
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,548
I've lived in Japan for 25 years now.

2
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:09,051
I like to collect rare objects.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,221
Ainu items, in particular.

4
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,724
That garment is one of my favorites.

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,476
That dress belonged to my great-aunt.

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,355
Her son-in-law sold it to you for 30 yen
and disappeared.

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,607
I'd like it back. I'll pay you.

8
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,360
30 yen?

9
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,612
Odd, I'm pretty sure it was 100 yen.

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,657
Say, Dunn,

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,411
do you know what starts a war?

12
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,207
It starts when a negotiation falls apart,

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,418
due to ridiculous demands.

14
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:49,091
I'll give you the seal garment for 30 yen,
if you get rid of a monster.

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,343
A monster?

16
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,513
Eddy, it's done it again!

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,478
This is where the horse was attacked.

18
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,230
The trail of blood leads into the woods.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,608
This track...

20
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,235
Look, something's over there!

21
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,613
That's it!

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,698
That's the monster!

23
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,784
It's not a monster.

24
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,035
It's a brown bear!

25
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,205
A reddish-furred brown bear
is carrying the horse.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,834
Shoot, Sugimoto.
My bow can't reach that far.

27
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,336
Move, Shiraishi!

28
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,260
Your ass is on my face!

29
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,306
You barely scratched it.
It ran because it was startled.

30
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,390
Damn it.

31
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,685
So the monster was
that reddish-furred brown bear.

32
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,022
Anyway, why was it carrying
the horse like that?

33
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,485
By carrying the prey on its back,
it can get away more easily.

34
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,947
It drags its prey deep into the woods
to have its meal.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,032
It may be smart, but it's still a bear.

36
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,327
I accept your deal.

37
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,997
Once that brown bear is killed,
the seal dress is mine.

38
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,043
This is the monster's claw.

39
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,880
Last winter, I shot this claw off his paw.

40
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,382
Its claw?

41
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,719
Yes, the track we saw
had all its digits intact.

42
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,931
Also,
last summer I shot out one of its eyes.

43
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,643
But the bear that ate my horse
had both eyes.

44
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,356
I call that reddish-furred brown bear
a monster

45
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,069
because its body parts seem to regenerate,
whether I blast off the claws or eyes.

46
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,072
That beast is immortal.

47
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,491
He's an immortal bear.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,580
If you think you can hunt it down,
then be my guest.

49
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,960
Shiraishi, don't come. You're clumsy
and will only get in our way.

50
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,757
Go south through this forest,
and find an abandoned farmhouse.

51
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,260
No one will mind, if you wait there.

52
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,349
Kiroranke, will you come with me?

53
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,394
{\an8}MONSTER

54
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,478
{\an8}Asirpa.

55
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,190
{\an8}I don't care about how many
of this American's horses get killed.

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,651
Isn't this a waste of time?

57
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,404
What else am I to do?

58
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,032
Kill the American
and take back that dress?

59
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,830
A seal dress is worn
during wedding ceremonies.

60
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,167
I don't want to stain it with blood
if I can help it.

61
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,130
There's the farmhouse. All right.

62
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,425
-What?
-Huh? What is it?

63
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,637
The bear was trying to carry this horse.

64
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,847
It fled all the way here.

65
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,477
Good boy. Come with us.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,395
You want to bring this horse along?

67
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,731
It's the brown bear's victim.

68
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,609
A tenacious brown bear will track it down.

69
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,904
What? Then we need to leave this horse!

70
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,949
We have no weapons to fight the bear with.

71
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,033
Shut your trap!

72
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,702
I can't leave it here,
knowing the bear will kill it!

73
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,873
Reddish fur...

74
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,668
Asirpa, look at this!

75
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,671
Reddish fur is scattered all around.

76
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,924
This must be the other horse
that went missing last week!

77
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,011
What are you doing?

78
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:26,100
The bear will see me on his mound
and will come charging at us.

79
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,479
Shiraishi,
don't make any sudden movements.

80
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,648
No matter what, don't run.

81
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,900
That bald idiot!

82
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,825
Throw your belt down and keep running!
Bears are afraid of snakes!

83
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,373
Hurry up, Shiraishi!

84
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,125
Wait for me!

85
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,961
What is going on?

86
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,964
What is happening?

87
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,466
There's a brown bear! Do you have a gun?

88
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,804
There's no gun here.

89
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,563
Shiraishi, help me with this.

90
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,481
Kiroranke.

91
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:18,277
Please, throw this horse out
for the bear to eat.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,031
Keep the bear's attention here,
and Sugimoto will catch up by evening.

93
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,575
Ouch, ouch!

94
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,203
The horse is displaying affection.
It likes you.

95
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,456
My head is bleeding though.

96
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,459
We'll block off the garden entrance.
Remove the floor mats!

97
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,627
What is the meaning of this?

98
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,214
You... how'd you get in?

99
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,175
From the back door. Why?

100
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,177
Shit, we got to block that off too!

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,763
-It's just you?
-Yes.

102
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,265
Why is there a horse in the living room?

103
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,059
A bear is right outside the house!

104
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,062
Hold on a minute, is this your house?

105
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,565
Yes, it is.

106
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,152
Interesting. Then who is this old geezer?

107
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,116
There it is!

108
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,411
It's missing an eye.

109
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,709
What? Another bear?

110
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,466
<i>That clumsy fool!</i>

111
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:32,226
We can't fight two bears at once.
We have to run!

112
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,276
Hey, can you stand? Let's get out of here.

113
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,904
That bear was missing a claw.

114
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,657
That was the bear with the blasted paw!

115
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,992
It's nothing superstitious.

116
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,913
The reddish-furred brown bear
wasn't immortal. There were two of them!

117
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,334
No, if that American was right,

118
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,254
there's a third bear
that isn't hurt at all.

119
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,631
There are three brown bears.

120
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,926
Hey, old man. You got a hammer?

121
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,266
These heads...
how long have they been here?

122
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,478
ROKU

123
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,356
Hey, what the hell is this about?

124
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,358
What are those?

125
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
Don't play dumb, geezer.

126
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,197
You reached this house before us.
You knew these were here.

127
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,909
I stayed by the fireplace,
so I didn't see. I'm telling the truth!

128
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,747
The housekeeper said
this farmhouse is unoccupied.

129
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,916
Do you really live here?

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,626
I...

131
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,128
Which is it?

132
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,882
Which one of you followed me
from Naganuma to kill me?

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,635
Shiraishi, are you there?

134
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,346
Sugimoto is here!

135
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,975
Over here!
We've barricaded all other openings.

136
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,101
Be careful!

137
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,353
The reddish-furred bear is near the house!

138
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,939
<i>There's the third bear.</i>

139
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,110
Sugimoto, move slowly.
Don't make any sudden movements.

140
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,451
-Geez!
-I'll stall the bear!

141
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,578
Out of ammo!

142
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,959
Throw your belt, Sugimoto!

143
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,385
Jump, Sugimoto!

144
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,181
All right!

145
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,767
That was way too close.

146
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,228
Damn it, my ammo pouch!

147
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,780
Don't let go, Sugimoto.

148
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,502
-Is there a gun here?
-Apparently, no.

149
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,796
Asirpa, where's your bow and arrows?

150
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,882
My bow is broken,
and I dropped all my arrows.

151
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,717
What's wrong with you, klutz?

152
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,100
Who are you, men?

153
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,686
I'm Tatsuya Nakazawa.

154
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,396
The name's Kiichiro Wakayama.

155
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,398
And these decapitated heads?

156
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,568
These crooks wanted me to cheat
at the horse race in Naganuma.

157
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,573
They paid for their failure with
their lives. One of these two killed them.

158
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,244
Take your clothes off.

159
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,665
The yakuza member after Kiroranke's life
will have tattoos.

160
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,127
We'll have him retrieve the ammo pouch.

161
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,677
<i>What? My bayonet!</i>

162
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,429
<i>So, that's it.</i>

163
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,890
You led that bear here.

164
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,893
If you don't take care of it,

165
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,980
I'll slice you up
and feed you to the bear.

166
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,278
So, Ainu man.

167
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,990
Thanks to you,
I lost a fortune on the horse race.

168
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,826
So, you're the horse owner's boss.

169
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,288
You cut off these heads to threaten me!

170
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,458
Or to instill fear before killing you.

171
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,210
Everyone, cut it out.

172
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,963
Our priority is getting out of here alive!

173
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,803
Fine, the young lady is right.

174
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,014
Let's call a truce.

175
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:44,394
But either way,
someone needs to go get the ammo pouch.

176
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,147
I'm a yakuza gambler.

177
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,485
These dice will decide who goes,
you or me.

178
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,946
-Let's do it.
-First, let me inspect the dice.

179
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,158
Oh, shit.

180
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,580
There they are.

181
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,211
They are legit dice, all right.

182
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,088
Damn right they are.

183
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,882
For the dealer... Nakazawa, was it?

184
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,885
This farmer will deal for us.
The game must be fair.

185
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,763
I'm dealing?

186
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,473
Before we get started, Nakazawa.

187
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,225
Take your clothes off too.

188
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,977
Yes.

189
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,031
Don't point your filthy nipples at Asirpa!
You're scaring her!

190
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,825
Those are nasty nipples! Put them away!

191
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,493
The hell is wrong with your nipples?

192
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:45,247
I am terribly sorry.

193
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,458
<i>Quite an actor, eh?</i>

194
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,045
Are we ready?

195
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,755
Come on. Get on with it.

196
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,011
<i>Quite the showman.</i>

197
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,389
<i>His skill in dealing dice...</i>

198
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,810
<i>is top-notch.</i>

199
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,273
You only get one chance! Make your choice!

200
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,275
-Even!
-Shut up, Shiraishi.

201
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,401
I call odd.

202
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,404
Great. My bet is on even.

203
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,156
Now, let's get on with it!

204
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,787
One and six! Odd!

205
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,331
Goddamn idiot!

206
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,749
Hey...

207
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,838
Look, it's a strand of hair!

208
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,131
This is a trick!

209
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,469
You can look through the basket's weaves
and tug the hair to change the roll!

210
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,513
This isn't a simple trick
any farmer can pull off.

211
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,182
Those two are accomplices!

212
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,726
He tried to cheat and messed up!

213
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,022
No... you would never make a mistake.

214
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,274
You botched the game on purpose!

215
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,235
Why do you always get in my way?

216
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,864
We pretended to be strangers
in front of these fools.

217
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,868
How could you leave those heads out
at a time like this?

218
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,703
You've fumbled this so bad!

219
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,872
You shouldn't have cheated on me!

220
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,212
I told you, he's a prostitute!
You're still upset about that?

221
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:22,135
You stared at that baldie's ass lustfully.

222
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,720
I did not!

223
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:28,767
Sleeping with a male prostitute
is like taking a piss.

224
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,978
Filthy. You're filthy! Don't touch me!

225
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,857
The bear's trying to break in!

226
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,611
No one cares about your lovers' quarrel.
Go get my ammo pouch!

227
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,367
Eat these, damn bears!

228
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,375
I hope the bear bites off
your penis, boss.

229
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,668
Shut up!

230
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,337
I should've left you in Naganuma!

231
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,387
Boss!

232
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,479
He's the prisoner!

233
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,778
Boss...!

234
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,365
-Show me your ass!
-Stop!

235
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,660
You're just an ordinary grunt!

236
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,246
Get your dirty ass out of my face!

237
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,666
But Boss says my ass is nice!

238
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,586
He even said my nipples are sexy!

239
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,753
Boss!

240
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,841
I would have never guessed that
he tattooed the codes on his legs.

241
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,973
I will not be eaten!

242
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,895
Boss, don't leave me!

243
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,856
Stand back, Asirpa!

244
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,077
I am the immortal Sugimoto!

245
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,833
Sugimoto!

246
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,184
Apply the bear fat on your face
and it won't scar.

247
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,520
The smell of this fat
is making my stomach growl.

248
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,149
Asirpa,
let's have a bite of the bear meat.

249
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,942
I cannot eat it.

250
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:47,447
This bear is a <i>Wenkamuy.</i>
It killed that man.

251
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,366
Asirpa.

252
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,203
This bear has both eyes
and all claws on its paws.

253
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,455
This one hasn't killed anyone.

254
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,707
I saw this bear up close. I'm sure of it.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,420
Are you sure? Really?

256
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,049
Drat, we don't have flaccid anemone.

257
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,679
Toss it in a meaty dish, and not only
does it enhance the meat's flavor,

258
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,431
but it also brings out the flavor
of other ingredients.

259
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,725
Asirpa, Asirpa.

260
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,977
We happen to have flaccid anemone.

261
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,316
I gathered some in the forest!

262
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,071
Sugimoto, this isn't flaccid anemone.

263
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,322
Oh, really?

264
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,784
This is <i>Suruku</i>, or wolf's bane.

265
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:37,372
They look similar this time of year.
It's easy to mistake one for another.

266
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,750
We almost consumed poison.

267
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,379
But thanks to your mistake,

268
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,798
we might be able to kill
the remaining bears.

269
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,736
The poison is weak and works slowly.
Stab it again!

270
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,157
No way!

271
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,743
The other bear is coming in from upstairs!

272
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,749
I sold you a horse about a month ago.

273
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,919
I need a weapon.

274
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:29,215
Give me the biggest weapon
you've got in your stash!

275
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,893
Shiraishi, take the horse and run!

276
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,150
Boss's sword...

277
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,195
Go without me, Sugimoto!

278
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,157
Stand up! We're getting out of here!

279
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,958
Princess!

280
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,002
Boss!

281
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,712
<i>-Princess?</i>
<i>-Princess?</i>

282
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,880
<i>Princess?</i>

283
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,634
Get down, Kiroranke!

284
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,056
Die, monster!

285
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,190
Damn it, I'm out of ammo.

286
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,942
There's one more left!

287
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,235
Get on!

288
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,535
Your country has wagons
that don't require horses?

289
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,496
My dear friend Ford
gave me this test model.

290
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,998
Faster!

291
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,626
Brown bears run much faster than this.

292
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,878
The poison is working.
They can't run much longer.

293
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,011
Princess!

294
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,263
Boss!

295
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,270
Princess!

296
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,670
So now you're running away?

297
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,262
A back door virgin no more.

298
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,391
Damn, the yakuza boss actually won.

299
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,912
Princess.

300
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,998
Serves you right, Boss.

301
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,670
You can't cheat behind my back anymore.

302
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,799
You're going to die with me.

303
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,930
At least I got to be your last.

304
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,101
You idiot.

305
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,538
Right, I'll peel his skin off.

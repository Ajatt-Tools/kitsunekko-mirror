Some kind of problem?

I just don't do well

"You just don't get it.
Bring Chief Tosu here."

The criminal could have had a weapon.

50
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,897
I told you not to move
until you got the signal.

51

Is this how you act
when a superior is talking?

52
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,870
I had assessed the situation.

53
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:27,624
He was holding a phone
in his dominant hand,

54
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,669
and a small bag in his left.

55
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:30,921
I judged that the criminal

56
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,884
wouldn't have been able
to counterattack quickly.

you don't come with us at all, Reika.

[Reika] I said I'm sorry.

this year, okay?

It's my first year as a detective,
so I shouldn't really be taking time off,

87
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,907
but my boss told me
to take time off when I can.

88
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,121
That's a good boss.
You might be in with a chance.

Please stop. You're always trying
to hook me up with people.

90

We may be family,
but it's still harassment.

I don't want to hear it either.

00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:59,808
I'm just worried.

93
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:02,897
You keep on getting buffer and buffer.

94
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,567
[Reika] That's harassment too.

00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:05,861
Here, Mom.

So today,

I arrested someone for the first time
since becoming a detective.

101

That's great.
But don't push yourself too hard.

Suppose Kyoichi killed Matori too?

The person with that one billion…

342
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:33,976
would be Kyoichi.

Don't just bring me Kyoichi.

killed Nobuto.

Hello.

[Shino chuckles]
You've finally spoken.

386
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:34,461
You heard about Yoshitatsu Matori's body
being found on Ongo Mountain, didn't you?

387
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,851
You're the one
who killed both Nobuto and his father,

388

aren't you?

What are you talking about?

[Shino] Both Nobuto and Matori

392
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:55,086
were in your daughter's room
just before they vanished.

393
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:59,554
Afterward, someone canceled the lease
on Matori's room and cleared it out.

394
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:00,639
And then…

395
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:04,939
the one billion yen
Matori had disappeared.

[Kasen] Tetsuo,

did you know a fire would break out?

460
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,300
I received a message.

461

-What?
-But…

462
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,561

Kasen.

465
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,585
Did you know that Natsume Soseki,

466
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:07,465
who was an English teacher,
translated "I love you" indirectly

467
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,181
by saying,
"The moon is beautiful, isn't it"?

468
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:14,103
Yes, what about it?

469
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:19,322
Like Soseki, some people on the internet
use certain wordplay…

470
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:21,786
You have a new message from Mr. Marsilea

471
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:24,082
[Tetsuo]
I read this in a mystery novel before…

472
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,923
"The moon should be beautiful tomorrow,"

473
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:32,390
is a threat that means "I will kill you."

474
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,020
The 9:51 part refers to the number 951,

475
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:37,734
which is firefighting jargon for arson.

476
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:43,538
[Tetsuo] I suddenly received
a message from Mr. Marsilea,

477
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:48,422
which was either a threat or a warning,
that said, "I will commit arson tonight."

478
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,388
So I prepared a fire extinguisher,
just in case.

when Akira was born?

879
00:52:40,815 --> 00:52:45,199
You promised that no matter what happens,
we'd protect our family.

880

Tetsuo,

Chief Yasumoto's call history,

we found that the last person he contacted
besides police personnel

was Tetsuo Tosu.

895

The two were then captured

has disappeared.

[officer 2] Does this mean
he was involved with Yasumoto's murder?

That, we don't know.

Finally, the Mano Syndicate
has slipped up.

that Tetsuo Tosu is connected
to the syndicate.

and going
to various battlefields overseas.

955

Kubo was a mercenary for a long time.

956
00:58:05,255 --> 00:58:09,346
Shino scouted him for the Mano Syndicate
after hearing the rumors about him.

[Osawa]
Shino gained great power by having Kubo

kill enemy bosses one after another

and taking all the credit.

Then…

961
00:58:31,057 --> 00:58:36,985
he had Kubo gather delinquents
to create a criminal organization.

Kubo is a pro. He never leaves a trace.

This is important material that shows
Shino had Kubo carry all this out.

[Tetsuo] It serves as evidence
of the Mano Syndicate's crimes.

Why didn't you hand this data
to the police?

want with me?

I want to talk with you.

988
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,554
[Reika] You were a member
of the Mano Syndicate, weren't you?

989
01:00:56,096 --> 01:00:57,683
[Kyoichi] That was a long time ago.

990
01:00:58,602 --> 01:01:00,438
I'm a detective now.

991
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:03,695
As a detective, I can bring you in.

992
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,085
Seven years ago,

993
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:16,053
did you kill Nobuto Matori?

994
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:19,811
No.

995
01:01:20,604 --> 01:01:22,357
It wasn't me who killed him.

996
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:26,365
Then why are you still on the run?

997
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:31,668
Before I came here,

998
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,880
I met with your mother.

999
01:01:35,466 --> 01:01:37,888
She's looking for you, all on her own.

The truth won't do you any good.

Even so,

I feel like I have to know.

Tell me.

1007
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:23,062
The reason Nobuto dated you…

1008
01:02:24,398 --> 01:02:26,318
was because the organization told him to.

1009
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:31,538
Nobuto had beaten
two other girls to death.

1010
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,546
Tetsuo Tosu found that out,

1011
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:38,050
and went to your room.

1012
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,189
But ever since that day,

1013
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:48,864
nobody has seen Nobuto.

What happened to your face?

01:02:52,328 --> 01:02:53,623
Someone's done that to you.

1016
01:02:53,707 --> 01:02:56,838
I ran into him here. Can't you tell?

1017
01:02:56,921 --> 01:02:57,923
[Reika] Did he hit you?

1018
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,635
He was going crazy in here.

is the person you thought of just now.

I was afraid I'd be traced

as long as I kept this one billion,

1383

01:49:56,555 --> 01:50:00,229
[Reika] The data contained
all the evidence of fraud and murder

1636
01:50:00,312 --> 01:50:03,360
committed by the Mano Syndicate up to now.

1637
01:50:04,362 --> 01:50:05,740
Shino is done.

1638
01:50:07,243 --> 01:50:08,704
He'll never leave prison.

1639
01:50:08,788 --> 01:50:10,667
[anchor] …regarding fraud and murder

1640
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:13,338
believed to have been committed
by the Mano Syndicate

1641
01:50:13,422 --> 01:50:16,386
under Shino's command have been found.

1642
01:50:21,104 --> 01:50:25,697
[Akira] Whoa! Wow! It's shaking!

1643
01:50:26,991 --> 01:50:28,786
[Akira babbles]

1644
01:50:29,872 --> 01:50:33,420
[Tetsuo] Even now,
the man remembers those words he shouted

1645
01:50:33,921 --> 01:50:35,340
toward the heavens

1646
01:50:35,717 --> 01:50:38,598
as if cursing, as if praying.

1647
01:50:42,313 --> 01:50:45,612
Had the man really protected his family?

1648
01:50:45,695 --> 01:50:46,989
[keyboard keys clacking]

1649
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,202
For seven years,

1650
01:50:49,786 --> 01:50:52,416
they had to lie to their child.

1651
01:50:54,922 --> 01:50:57,134
It was he who brought that upon his wife.

1652
01:50:58,053 --> 01:51:00,808
The family life
he and his wife had vowed to

1653
01:51:01,226 --> 01:51:02,896
was never meant to be.

1654
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,525
The man…

1655
01:51:05,025 --> 01:51:07,363
had changed that life.

1656
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:10,954
Those seven years of their child's life
can never be returned.

1657
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:14,711
[soft chuckle]
Kyoichi?

1658
01:51:15,797 --> 01:51:16,882
I'm home.

1659
01:51:17,842 --> 01:51:20,097
[♪ soft somber music playing]

1660
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:21,266
[Tetsuo] To protect

1661
01:51:22,686 --> 01:51:24,523
one's beloved family…

1662
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:29,950
might not be about always being with them.

1663
01:51:32,956 --> 01:51:34,458
Letting go of your family

1664
01:51:35,502 --> 01:51:37,339
is another way to protect them.

1665
01:51:40,555 --> 01:51:41,807
So with this,

1666
01:51:43,268 --> 01:51:44,353
I am no longer

1667
01:51:45,272 --> 01:51:46,441
a husband…

1668
01:51:47,986 --> 01:51:49,155
or a father.

1669
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,002
[sobs]

1670
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:07,901
Are you okay?

1671
01:52:19,423 --> 01:52:20,510
I'm okay.

1672
01:52:22,304 --> 01:52:23,306
[soft chuckle]

1673
01:52:23,849 --> 01:52:24,851
[sniffles]

1674
01:52:26,145 --> 01:52:27,649
I'm the Queen of Nagging!

1675
01:52:27,732 --> 01:52:31,197
-Nag, nag! Nag, nag!
-[both laugh]

1676
01:52:33,994 --> 01:52:35,080
[Tetsuo] The man…

1677
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:38,044
shouted toward the heavens.

1678
01:52:42,136 --> 01:52:43,138
Perhaps…

1679
01:52:46,603 --> 01:52:48,733
the day will come…

1680
01:52:52,322 --> 01:52:53,743
when all of this will be forgiven.

1681
01:53:09,941 --> 01:53:13,741
Dear Tetsuo Tosu

1682
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:22,592
Kasen Tosu

1683
01:53:53,612 --> 01:54:00,626
The best dad in the world

1684
01:54:02,087 --> 01:54:03,674

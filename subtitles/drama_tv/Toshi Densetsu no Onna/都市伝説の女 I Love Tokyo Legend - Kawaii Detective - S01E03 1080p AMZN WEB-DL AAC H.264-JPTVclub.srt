3
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,910
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,831
- Miki, over here.
- Okay.
Cheese!

5
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,933
Miki, let me put the veil on.

6
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,989
- Ah, please.
- Okay.
That's it.

7
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:45,642
The ceremony will start in twenty minutes
so if everyone could leave.

8
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,029
Okay.
Here we go.

9
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:51,099
- See you later.
- Thanks for everything.

10
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:57,105
Thank you, Sachie.

11
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,891
- See you later.
- Thank you very much.

12
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:29,939
The groom isn't supposed to see the bride
before the wedding.

13
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,926
- Huh?
- It's an old superstition.

14
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:37,980
Is that right?
Well, if that's the case...

15
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,183
Stop it!

16
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:13,148
Stop following me!

17
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,354
Excuse me!

18
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,265
It's time.

19
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,357
Someone call the police!

20
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,740
Get the groom!
The bride...!

21
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,652
- Ah!
- My back!

22
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:04,533
- What's that all about?
- When an eyelash falls out

23
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:08,420
Put it on your right index finger and make a wish

24
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,474
- if you can blow it off, it'll come true.
- Really?

25
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,527
Enough with these stories!
I'm sick of it.

26
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,563
- What are you doing, Ando?
- I'm trying it!

27
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,533
Otonashi-san, how about this place?

28
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:24,539
All you can drink for three hours.
And only for 2500 yen.

29
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,522
Limited time...

30
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:31,526
- Why don't I hold the party?
- What?
At your place?

31
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:34,516
I want everyone's contact details.
Put them on this mailing list.

32
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,615
- Okay.
- Yes.

33
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:40,685
- And make sure Haruki is on there too.

34
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,543
- Group date?
- No.
It's a meeting for people from an urban legends group.

35
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,563
I joined recently and so get to know people better

36
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,595
I became the secretary.

37
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,531
- Katsuura.
- Yes.

38
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,534
Can I have a word?

39
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,557
You and Otonashi seem to be getting on very well.

40
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,543
- What do you like about her?
- Her looks.

41
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,441
- Shallow.
- Anything else?

42
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,647
Face.
Legs.
Well,

43
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:09,531
you've seen her, you know what I mean.

44
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:13,518
But wouldn't you be better off

45
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:18,124
with someone who's good looking but also
has a good personality?

46
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:23,548
Nope.
With that perfect style she's got I doubt anyone
in the world looks as good as she does.

47
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,531
Hm. I see.

48
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:30,622
Her personality is just the finishing touch to
her beautiful face.

49
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,520
Perhaps you need glasses?

50
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,489
'Morning.

51
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,545
What a waste to fill such a large office with
these bunch of subordinates.

52
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,428
- Since you don't look busy,
could you do some work for me?
- An incident?

53
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,553
Well, police work is never finished so
if you don't mind, Tannai-san...

54
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:48,536
It happened at a wedding hall in Okutama.

55
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:51,423
- What happened?
- Tsukiko.

56
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:54,459
It seems the bride has gone missing.

57
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,595
- Missing?
- The only trace left of her

58
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,665
was blood.

59
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:18,583
Samejima Miki.
28.
Beautician.

60
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:22,537
She was in here waiting for the ceremony to begin?

61
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,242
Yes.
Ah, I'm Nishiura Sachie.

62
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,525
We work together.

63
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,528
I was helping her with her hair and make-up.

64
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,615
Was she acting strange at all?

65
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:37,685
I've never seen her so happy.

66
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:42,457
And you are the groom Maruyama Keisuke?
A Civil Servant.

67
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,492
Yes.

68
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:47,545
When was the last time you saw your bride?

69
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:52,484
- Last night.
- Did you notice anything different?

70
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:54,619
She was crying.

71
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,540
Crying?
Why?

72
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,527
She received a strange email.
It upset her.

73
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:06,651
- Have you got the bride's mobile phone?
- We haven't found it, no.

74
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,168
Her bag's gone too.

75
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,751
It was a white handbag.

76
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,134
Are you cleaning things up again?

77
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,679
No, not at all.
Sorry.

78
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:30,505
The blood we found also seems to be from the bride

79
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:32,507
but it's barely a smear.

80
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:35,563
We'll need another sample in order to verify it.

81
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:38,480
- Do you think someone else took her?
- No.

82
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,519
At least, we're keeping all our options open
while we investigate.

83
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,537
Even if she wanted to leave, other people
may be involved.

84
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,525
People often run away with a lover

85
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,611
- before the big day.
- Shibayama.

86
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,661
- Excuse us.

87
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Perhaps it was because of that thing?

88
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:01,539
- Don't be absurd. It's just superstition.
- Superstition?
What is?

89
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,506
- Otonashi.
- Just here...

90
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:10,514
When it was New Year, all the girls from the shop
went to an amusement park and took this photo.

91
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:14,532
This is Miki, but if you look at the person
behind her.

92
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:17,539
- It looks just like her.
- Did she have a twin?

93
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,538
The same face, all right.

94
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:25,527
- Did Miki have a sister?
- No. That's why it scared her.

95
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:28,530
Miki believe in things like the occult and

96
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,239
she believed that if you meet someone who
looks like you, then you will die soon after.

97
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:35,637
Like meeting your other self, right.

98
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,707
Yes, people have thought this for a long time.

99
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,481
Hey, careful!

100
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,584
It's here... this...

101
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,554
This is bad.
We have to find her fast.

102
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:54,542
- Huh?
- This is not just a disappearance.

103
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:57,530
I think something terrible has happened to her.

104
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,678
- Terrible? Like what?
- Otonashi!
Cut it out!

105
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:03,748
This case is the result of an urban legend!

106
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:09,270
Gohara is deliberately harassing us.

107
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,374
Calling you whenever he feels like it.

108
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,309
That's enough.

109
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,430
Well, let's retrace the bride's final moments.

110
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
- Sir.
- Otonashi.

111
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,338
That useless...
where is she?

112
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:01,506
What are you praying for?

113
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:07,328
Could I ask you more about Miki-san's
behaviour last night?

114
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:10,402
Miki would never leave me like that
on the day of the wedding.

115
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:13,334
Now, if I could be left alone.

116
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:16,337
Whether she ran away or not is unimportant.

117
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,440
Huh?

118
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,510
Even if she had the chance.

119
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:26,297
Miki-san's very pretty, isn't she?

120
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,501
It was love at first sight.

121
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:33,571
I saw her through the window of the beauty parlour.

122
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:40,494
Until then, I'd only ever gone to the barber's.

123
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,382
Welcome.

124
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:48,452
Whenever I saw her, she was always laughing happily.

125
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:54,342
But last night you said she was crying?

126
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:58,363
Lately, she'd had these mood swings.

127
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,332
Do you know what those emails were about?

128
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:05,386
I never read them, but she seemed to get
quite a few.

129
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:10,456
- Who from?
- She didn't recognise the address.

130
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:16,331
Perhaps from the other Miki-san? Who knows.

131
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,366
Eh?

132
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:23,338
I mean the woman in the photo.
That one that looks like her.

133
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:27,308
Ah, that photo isn't real.

134
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:30,378
There's something odd about it.

135
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,649
What do you mean?

136
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,332
Well...

137
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:38,353
I think that Sachie-san was blackmailing Miki.

138
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:41,406
Really? Sachie-san?

139
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:46,327
But, they worked together.
They seem really close.

140
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,430
More like rivals.
It was quite intense.

141
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,227
You look beautiful.

142
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,550
So how about this dress?

143
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,427
- Sachie-san's dress was nicer than this.
- Miki...

144
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,333
Hello, Sachie?
What's up?

145
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:11,112
"Miki?
I've decided"

146
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:12,220
What?

147
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,275
"I'm going to enter the styling contest."

148
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:20,328
That's great...

149
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:23,336
- Styling Contest?
- It a nationwide competition

150
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:26,284
for hair stylists.

151
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:29,320
Miki was thinking of entering

152
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,323
but only one person from each shop can enter.

153
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:36,277
And then Sachie-san decided to enter.

154
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,249
Yes.

155
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,354
It was around this time that
she began seeing a woman who looked like her.

156
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:46,354
It was supposed to be my turn.
That's what the manager told me.

157
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:50,358
- You can enter next year.
- I can never win.

158
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:53,739
Even the customers prefer her to me.

159
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,364
Having fun and chatting.

160
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,434
Miki...

161
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:07,492
Why are you here?

162
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:13,448
Why are you following me?!

163
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,355
- What are you laughing at?
- Miki?

164
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,357
- Get out of here!
- Miki! Stop it!

165
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,456
Calm down!

166
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,526
Why is this happening?

167
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,350
Ever since that photo,
Sachie's been nothing but trouble.

168
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,320
But from the beginning, I found it suspicious.

169
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,323
So to threaten Miki-san

170
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:41,326
- she used the photograph?
- You see

171
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:45,496
That sort of thing doesn't exist.
Your "Other Self."

172
00:12:57,395 --> 00:13:00,145
What?
Tsukiko-san's disappeared?

173
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:03,164
I mean she went off without us.

174
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:06,134
I left several messages on her phone.

175
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:09,070
It's useless.
Don't bother.

176
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,159
- "What is it?"
- Ah, Tsukiko-san?

177
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,141
- She answered?

178
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:16,177
- She only answers when it suits her.
- Indeed.

179
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,146
Damn.
I can't go on like this.

180
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:21,099
Where are you now?

181
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,154
Huh? I'm investigating, of course.

182
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:26,157
I want to know if that other Miki is a real person.

183
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,259
"By the way, I found a place that does Okinawan -"

184
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,169
Thanks for you work.

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,359
See you tomorrow.

186
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:49,144
Why would I want to fake this photo of Miki?

187
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:53,164
If we ask Forensics to look at it,
we should know if it's real.

188
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:56,151
Could you send it to this address, please.

189
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:59,103
Of course.

190
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,191
It's true we were rivals.

191
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:08,261
But we've always worked together.
I want her to be happy.

192
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:21,142
I've heard that recently Miki-san had been
emotionally unstable.

193
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:28,132
Perhaps it's down to that curse of her other self?

194
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,219
Curse of the other self?
Such as?

195
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:36,289
Well, there was this time when we were
both practising.

196
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,131
- You looked really happy the other day.
- Huh?

197
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:47,272
When I bumped into you and Keisuke in front of
that landmark at Nishishinjuku.

198
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:51,322
You two were so romantic.

199
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,128
- I wasn't there.
- Hm?

200
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,132
- I've never been there.
- But... I have a photo.

201
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:05,119
You and Keisuke-san holding hands.

202
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:09,224
- Eh?

203
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:11,294
Excuse me.

204
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:25,123
Who's that?

205
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:34,132
Miki?

206
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:37,085
She's there!
I saw her!

207
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:41,122
- Who did you see?
- It was me!
I saw myself!!

208
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,074
- Calm down!
- I was me!!

209
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:47,128
Was this the mirror where she saw her double?

210
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,164
Do you think Miki is okay?

211
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:52,150
Her other self...

212
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,136
The Germans have a word for it:
Doppelganger.

213
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:58,159
But this refers to someone who just looks like you.

214
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:02,143
- This case seems to have a spiritual aspect.
- Spiritual?

215
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:09,149
There are reports that it's linked to brain disease
and because of that,
if you see your alter ego then you are near death.

216
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,122
This could be how the legend began.

217
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:18,142
The writer Akutagawa Ryunosuke is a famous example.
It's been said that he saw his alter ego.

218
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:22,146
As you probably know, he committed suicide.

219
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:26,134
But Miki will be okay, won't she?

220
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:29,203
We're doing all we can to find her.

221
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,542
Please, help Miki.

222
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,323
Please.

223
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:39,097
"Huh? Nishishinjuku?"

224
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,132
By Island Tower in Shinjuku.

225
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:43,187
Do you remember taking a photo with Miki-san?

226
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:46,137
In front of the Love Sculpture.

227
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:49,123
Did Sachie tell you about that?

228
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:52,126
Miki also asked me about that.

229
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:55,113
"But it's also a fake"

230
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:57,181
Probably to scare Miki.

231
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:00,234
She never wanted to lose to Miki.

232
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:03,304
"Whether it was in work or in marriage."

233
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:13,248
- "I have to go now."
- Okay.

234
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,143
- Her sister?
- My name is Otonashi Miyako.

235
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,212
I'm very sorry.

236
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:31,115
My sister has come down with the 'flu.

237
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:34,118
She asked me to pass on her apologies.

238
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:37,141
- But she can't work today...
- Flu?
At this time of year?

239
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:40,228
Is that right.
Please tell your sister to take things easy

240
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:45,748
to get well quickly and we hope to see her
back at work soon.

241
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,267
Once again, apologies for my sister being a burden.

242
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,351
Okay.
Thanks for coming.

243
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:55,512
Tannai-san.
Do you believe her?

244
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,307
Of course I don't.

245
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:04,296
- Those two sisters are cut from the same cloth.
- No doubt about it.

246
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:08,253
Sister, I think I got you off the hook.

247
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:16,097
- We have sightings of the missing bride.
- Where?

248
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:19,163
On the day of the wedding, late that evening

249
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,153
She was seen at a station by an attendant
by herself.

250
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:24,102
She seemed sad but peaceful.

251
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,154
He remembers her clearly.

252
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:30,278
The description of her clothes matches what
she was wearing that morning.

253
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:33,328
So she ran away by herself.

254
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:37,131
I'm taking it now.
Say cheese.

255
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,134
Thank you very much.

256
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:45,022
They say if a couple can pass between
the V and E without touching the sides

257
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:48,059
then they will fall in love.

258
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,144
Is that right?
Well, let's see.

259
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:54,165
- Forget it. No way.
- What?
That's the only reason I came here.

260
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:58,139
So Sachie-san was standing here, and
Miki-san and Keisuke-san were there.

261
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:03,127
But both Miki-san and
Keisuke-san say they've never been here.
Which one of them is lying?

262
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:05,276
It's a real puzzle, huh?

263
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:07,953
I guess it could be any of them.

264
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,396
But who... and
why?

265
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,306
Miki-san!

266
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,293
It's her!

267
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:26,214
Come back!
Miki-san!

268
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:28,284
Miki-san!

269
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:32,203
Wait, Miki-san!

270
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,273
Wait!

271
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,675
Miki-san,
Miki-san.

272
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,515
Miki-san!

273
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,101
"You in the mini skirt!
Halt!"

274
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:53,959
- We're in the middle of work.
- What are you talking about?

275
00:19:54,208 --> 00:20:00,128
Katsuura,
you can't let yourself be dragged around all day.
Akiyama in Forensics is angry at you.

276
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,913
Really?
This is bad.

277
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,015
- We'll take you back.
- Jump in.

278
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,523
Sorry, Tsukiko-san.
I'll see you tonight at the meeting.

279
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,047
Where did you go, Miki-san?

280
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:24,002
Honestly, Katsuura.
What do you see in her?

281
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,072
Well, obviously, it's her perfect...

282
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:30,076
Hm?

283
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,027
What's wrong?

284
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:37,097
There was something odd about Miki-san

285
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,923
Sorry I'm late.

286
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,876
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.

287
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,930
My lunch break is almost over, so
if you could be brief.

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,833
Do you absolutely promise that you won't lie?

289
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,918
Of course.

290
00:20:56,988 --> 00:21:00,905
If something terrible happens to Tokyo

291
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:05,930
The building of the Metropolitan Government
can turn into a 243 metre high robot.

292
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,931
- Is that true?
- Huh?

293
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:13,922
I thought that, since you're a civil servant,
you might know something.

294
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,872
- Is that all you wanted?
- Sorry.

295
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:22,894
- I suppose that is bad of me.
- Forget it.

296
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:25,980
- But I did see Miki-san.
- Eh?

297
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,566
Not far from here.

298
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,852
I called her name, but she ran away.

299
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,922
Miki...?

300
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:39,928
This means she wanted to escape.

301
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,915
- Actually, I got an email from her.
- What?

302
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,900
It said
"Don't look for me."

303
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,990
Miki says she's with relatives, and most recently

304
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
I got this.

305
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I guess you can stop the investigation.

306
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:17,936
So that story about the government
buildings turning into a robot

307
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:21,903
- That has to be a hoax, right?
- Huh? What's that?

308
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,923
Wait, wait.
That civil servant

309
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:27,926
didn't actually deny the story, did he?

310
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:30,929
Eh, he has a point.

311
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,902
In the metro, there's a branch line
just for evacuating politicians

312
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,901
It's arranged like a spiders web.

313
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,970
This is probably true.

314
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Er, what branch line is this?

315
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,977
Huh?

316
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:51,047
- You don't even know about that?
- Well...

317
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:58,943
Japan's Self-Defence Force and government agencies
are connected by tunnels leading to each basement.

318
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:00,975
Ah, I heard that.

319
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,949
There are many routes underground that
you won't find on any map.

320
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:07,982
- Hmm.
- That's right.

321
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:11,052
- Excuse me.

322
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:15,907
Haruki didn't come?

323
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,162
Did you really ask him?

324
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,963
I left messages.
He didn't answer.

325
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,016
- Haruki must be a dick.
- Show some respect.

326
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,869
- Mr Haruki must be a dick.

327
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,905
Of course he wouldn't come...

328
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,925
Just like Miki, he just disappears.

329
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,912
But someone else who looks just like you...
An illusion?

330
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,915
Oh, about that...

331
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:43,868
This photo is real.

332
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:47,905
This hasn't been tampered or altered in any way.

333
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:50,875
So, this image here...

334
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:54,829
There's a chance it all may be true, Tsukiko-san.

335
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:56,881
Well...

336
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:59,020
- Thanks for the evening.
- Bye. Thanks for coming.

337
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,070
You should do a bit of research next time.

338
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:32,034
Shh.

339
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:51,903
And you know what else...

340
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:56,808
Miki-san ran away, so there was never
any crime in the first place

341
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:59,911
so how can I keep investigating?

342
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:04,849
How can I prove if there really is another
person exactly like her?

343
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,115
Who knows.

344
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,986
Do you want some water?

345
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:11,056
Yeah.

346
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,860
Here.

347
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,029
Ah! Sorry!

348
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:22,099
Sorry about that.

349
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:26,592
You know, Katsuura.

350
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,122
You're one of the good guys.

351
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:31,979
Huh?

352
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,934
- I'm home.

353
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:42,920
- Welcome back.
- Oh, Katsuura-san.

354
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,942
Are you still working on that case?

355
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:47,959
Er... that's right!
You got here just in time.

356
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,994
Ah, that's it.

357
00:25:50,064 --> 00:25:52,934
- Why don't we do one of your experiments?
- Hm?

358
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,139
Like before.

359
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,003
Same place, same time, same everything.

360
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:00,072
Hmph.

361
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:09,785
I knew it.
She's everything I hoped she would be.

362
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:14,305
I really didn't think she'd agree to
wearing a wedding dress.

363
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:18,276
Good job I said it was for the experiment.

364
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:21,282
And this is how things were when Miki-san
went missing?

365
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:24,282
That's right.
It was tough, but I did it.

366
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:26,167
Something for...

367
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:29,254
- Hm?
- It's an old wedding tradition.

368
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:33,294
On the day of the wedding, the bride is
given four things to have during the ceremony

369
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,331
and these things will bring her good luck,
so the legend goes.

370
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:39,264
These things are called "something for".

371
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:42,303
First is something blue.

372
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:45,320
Which is a colour that brings happiness.

373
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,289
Second is something old.

374
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,209
An heirloom passed down from an ancestor.

375
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,143
The third is something new.

376
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:55,280
Like a gift or a present.

377
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,317
But the fourth is something borrowed.

378
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:01,269
From the people in the room.

379
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:03,271
Borrowed?
Like what?

380
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:08,276
Something from a close friend, to send them
into a happy married life.

381
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:12,297
It's a way of sharing good luck.

382
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:17,268
But the fourth one isn't here.

383
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:21,401
When I was here with Forensics, there were
only three things here.

384
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:24,584
Because I know what you're like, I don't doubt it.

385
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:29,446
Hmmm.

386
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:38,272
Ah, hello.
It's Detective Otonashi, here.

387
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:41,225
"Something for"?

388
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:44,262
That's right.
I gave her something borrowed.

389
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,264
"What did you lend to her?"

390
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,287
A pair of scissors I won when I
entered a competition.

391
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:51,235
Scissors?

392
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:54,372
Did you ever get them back?

393
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:56,442
"No."

394
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:01,463
Well, thank you very much.
We'll be in touch.

395
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:10,271
Hm. Miki-san was wearing this dress

396
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:16,244
and those three things, and a pair
of scissors were there.

397
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:36,034
Have we found... an urban legend?

398
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:39,034
Not even close.

399
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:54,049
Ah!

400
00:28:57,939 --> 00:29:00,872
Eh?! My other self?

401
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:04,893
What is this?
My alter ego?
Doppelganger?

402
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:08,880
Am I about to die?
I don't want to die.

403
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,883
Wait a second.
I made that photo.

404
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:16,975
If you look closely,
you'll see I've added six Tannais.

405
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:19,858
Really?
Hm, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

406
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:21,843
Wait. 
Where's the other one?

407
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:24,896
The last one is here!

408
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:27,949
Well, okay, but this is a bit odd.

409
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,819
You're making fun of me, right?

410
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:32,253
No, not at all.

411
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,889
I sent it to you by mistake.

412
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:38,930
Even so, I was so scared I wanted to cry.
I guess Miki-san was the same.

413
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,980
If someone keeps sending you this kind of photo.

414
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,050
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:48,887
The problem is, who would send these

416
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:53,975
to Miki-san on the evening before her wedding?

417
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:58,045
And also, where have those scissors gone?

418
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:07,909
By the way, Katsuura, weren't you bothered by 
something about this figurine?

419
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,275
- Yes.
- What?

420
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:15,263
This one isn't positioned right.

421
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,286
In order to balance it,
there should be another angel on the other side.

422
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:21,335
This composition doesn't make sense.

423
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,387
It's like...

424
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:28,082
When you see guard dogs at the shrine.
If there's only one, it feels wrong.

425
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:33,431
Ah!

426
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:40,321
Tsukiko-san?

427
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:42,391
But.

428
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:53,451
- Did you hear that?
- What?

429
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,388
Wait!
The dress!

430
00:30:57,358 --> 00:31:00,358
Be careful of the dress!

431
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,273
Wait a sec!

432
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:37,245
- Can it be...?
- What?

433
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:42,333
But afterwards we saw Miki-san.

434
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:45,319
You saw her, didn't you.
In Shinjuku.

435
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,389
Wait, Miki-san!

436
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:51,275
- Well, in a way, but...
- But what?

437
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,277
It took a while to work out

438
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:56,280
what I found so strange about Miki-san.

439
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,399
What's that?

440
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:00,469
Hm?

441
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:03,405
The thing is...

442
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:18,437
What's this?

443
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,279
Ah, Tannai-san.
Excellent work.

444
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:24,295
Apparently it's just a case of a runaway bride,

445
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,244
Yes, that's right.

446
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:29,300
There was hardly any reason for us to go at all.

447
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,250
What's this?
Still complaining, Shibayama?

448
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,289
I mean, you two.
Are you wearing matching outfits or something?

449
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:38,339
Tannai-san, we've got a problem.
It's Tsukiko.

450
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:40,258
What's she done this time?

451
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,287
Thanks you for coming when you must be so busy.

452
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:56,240
- Have you found something new?
- Yes.

453
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,278
Sad to say, it's a painful story.

454
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:03,364
Otonashi!
This case is closed!

455
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:05,684
It's nothing to do with us any more.

456
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:08,286
- Oop!
- Actually,

457
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:11,238
Miki-san was supposed to walk along here.

458
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:14,275
If she hadn't seen her alter ego,

459
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:17,348
or her doppelganger.

460
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:20,231
And that's why she didn't.

461
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,249
Wrong.

462
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,270
The other Miki-san never existed.

463
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,239
What?

464
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:32,360
Not another Miki-san, strictly speaking,

465
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,430
but one who came close enough.

466
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,272
- Miki!!
- No.

467
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:48,309
This is Makihara Hitomi.

468
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:50,348
She's no relation at all to Miki-san.

469
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,230
The resemblance is purely coincidental.

470
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,385
Is it possible?
This kind of similarity?

471
00:33:57,455 --> 00:34:03,455
The theory is that everyone has at least
three doubles in the world.

472
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:10,264
Could it be, I saw her...

473
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:13,250
That's right, Sachie-san.

474
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,272
The two people you met in Nishishinjuku

475
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,258
were not Keisuke-san and Miki-san

476
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:26,280
but rather him and Hitomi-san.

477
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,283
But, they seemed so in love.

478
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:34,355
That's right.
This meeting was a bit unfortunate.

479
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:38,425
Wasn't it, Keisuke-san?

480
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:43,264
You fell in love with Miki-san

481
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:46,367
but then you met

482
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:50,437
someone else who looked just like her.
Hitomi-san.

483
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:58,445
Maruyama-san, is this true?

484
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:11,425
Miki-san was always working.
Late into the night, seven days a week.

485
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:16,495
She had less and less time for me, until...

486
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,394
Miki?

487
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:42,256
Unlike Miki-san, Hitomi-san was quite...
homely.

488
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:45,326
Then in front of that sculpture

489
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:48,396
a photo was taken of the two of you together.

490
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:53,267
I felt sorry for Miki,

491
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:56,337
but recently she'd become irrational

492
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:59,273
when we were together, it was a nightmare.

493
00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:03,227
So you tried to make it worse before the wedding.

494
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:06,347
Well...

495
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:10,234
By then, there was no point in talking to her.

496
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:13,270
What are you saying?
That's terrible!

497
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,423
It was terrible.

498
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:22,493
Hitomi-san, you sympathised with his story,
didn't you?

499
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,219
So you began to harass Miki-san.

500
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,287
Huh?

501
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,307
You became her other self.

502
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:37,378
You sent strange photos of you to Miki.

503
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:41,448
Why would you do such a thing?

504
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,292
When two identical women have
feelings for the same man.

505
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:54,311
Do you see?

506
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:57,364
Hitomi.

507
00:36:57,434 --> 00:36:59,684
I even went to meet her a few times.

508
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:07,258
Who is that woman?

509
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:10,327
I wanted to speak to her face to face.

510
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:15,397
I sent a photo to her on her wedding day.

511
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:23,274
If she went through with the wedding
he would belong to Miki-san.

512
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:27,278
I wanted to tell her before it was too late.

513
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:31,265
Of course, I wanted all three of us to meet.

514
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,284
So...

515
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:36,403
You went to see her before the ceremony.

516
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:40,473
But it turned into an argument.

517
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:47,264
Hitomi-can stabbed Miki-san,

518
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:52,303
and Hitomi-san dressed in Miki's clothes

519
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:57,373
took her belongings, and escaped.

520
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:03,264
What?
Are you saying Miki is dead?

521
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:07,234
Unfortunately, this case is not just
a disappearance.

522
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:10,321
Miki-san died several days ago.

523
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,335
You're wrong.
She's alive.

524
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,275
You saw the email.

525
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:17,278
When Miki-san found out about Hitomi and me

526
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:20,281
- she decided to leave.
- Miki-san's phone.

527
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:22,333
One of you has it, right?

528
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:26,270
You sent emails to make it look like she was alive.

529
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,273
- That's not true.
- Otonashi.

530
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:32,259
Assuming they did kill Miki-san,

531
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,428
how did they dispose of the body?

532
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:36,811
They had a perfect method right here.

533
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:40,367
This bag for wedding dresses.

534
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:44,437
They put her in one of these and carried her out

535
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:51,211
while they were sure no one would enter the room.

536
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:52,286
That day,

537
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:55,319
there were two matching angel figurines in the room.

538
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:58,285
But where did one of them go?

539
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:03,355
You put it in with the body.

540
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:15,386
Why would he do that?

541
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,456
So the body would sink to the bottom of the pond.

542
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,347
But this is all guesswork.

543
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:29,417
Yes.
That's why were searching the pond now.

544
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Miki-san's body is somewhere in this pond.

545
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:50,220
Found it?

546
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,289
- No.
- What?

547
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:57,297
No matter how many times I look I can't find
any trace of a body.

548
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:59,279
No way...

549
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:04,284
I searched the whole pond, but there's nothing.

550
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:06,353
Is this a joke?

551
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:09,293
You think it's funny to called people murderers?

552
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:11,375
I very sorry about this.

553
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:14,445
That can't be.
Miki-san should be here.

554
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:18,415
Otonashi!
Cut it out.

555
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,285
It must be in here.

556
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:24,254
Forget it, Tsukiko-san.
I already looked.

557
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:26,290
- But...
- That's enough!

558
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,275
Let's go.

559
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:32,262
Otonashi, you've gone too far this time.

560
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:35,215
Apologise to these two people now!

561
00:40:35,285 --> 00:40:37,284
You're no cop, that's for sure.

562
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:41,291
You're off my team, and I don't care what
the Assistant Commissioner says.

563
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:43,357
Apologise now!
Do it!

564
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:46,427
Otonashi, do as you're told!

565
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:02,642
I'm very sorry for the offence I've caused.

566
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,357
It's Gohara.

567
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:15,142
Hello, Tannai-san here.

568
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:17,277
Tannai-san, we've got some evidence
that you missed.

569
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:21,278
- What?
- The case of the runaway bride.

570
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:24,314
I know.
I should say -

571
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:26,483
"We've found the body."

572
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:28,553
You've found the body?

573
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,925
You've found the body?

574
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,893
It was found in Tenjin Lake

575
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:39,963
by some fishermen.

576
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:43,968
They called the police.

577
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:50,777
Gohara, tell me: the murder weapon...
was it a pair of scissors?

578
00:41:50,827 --> 00:41:56,863
Also, is there something like an angel
there to act as a weight?

579
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,933
Huh?

580
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:03,055
Wait...

581
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:06,105
how did you know all that?

582
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:10,947
The body was found in Tenjin Lake.

583
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:13,247
Tenjin Lake?

584
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,067
Ah! I've got it!

585
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:21,090
- This is connected.
- Connected?

586
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,341
This pond and Tenjin Lake may be far apart

587
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:28,310
but they're part of the same water system

588
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,280
linked by underground tunnels.

589
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:36,285
A system of tunnels not on any map...

590
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:39,372
I've heard of these, Shibayama-san.

591
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:41,257
Part of the underground city.

592
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:44,276
Huh? Know about what?
What underground city?

593
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:45,576
I see,

594
00:42:45,927 --> 00:42:53,272
because the water circulates the body that had
sunk moved to Tenjin Lake through the tunnels.

595
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,318
I see.

596
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,306
Oh, the call!
Did he hang up?

597
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:01,347
Still there?
We have a suspect to the murder.

598
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:03,512
Suspect?

599
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,534
"I'll give you all the details later."

600
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,586
I'll do the questioning.

601
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:10,602
Just bring them into custody.

602
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,605
"Understood."

603
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,827
I guess mad old Tannai's not senile yet.

604
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:17,846
Looks like he didn't miss the evidence after all.

605
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,561
- Hey you!
- Ow!

606
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,348
I wish I had the time to gossip like you do.

607
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:24,503
- Deal with the body.
- Yes. Sorry, sir.

608
00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:27,603
- Carry it gently.
- Sir!

609
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:29,673
It's important.

610
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:39,695
Would you two please accompany me to the station.

611
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,452
Hitomi-san.

612
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:47,506
What did you talk about with Miki-san?

613
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:49,525
Nothing.

614
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:53,595
She immediately started talking about

615
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:56,665
a vision of herself in a black wedding dress.

616
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:08,194
Miki, we need to talk.

617
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:18,862
Pleased to meet you.

618
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:22,273
I'm Makihara Hitomi.

619
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:28,030
The woman in the black dress.

620
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,066
Huh?

621
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:33,085
The black wedding dress!

622
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:36,142
Why were you dressed like that?
Who are you, anyway?!

623
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:38,107
Miki, wait.

624
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,159
I hate you!
Get out!

625
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:43,229
I'm the only real Miki...

626
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:48,220
- and I can prove it!
- Miki! Stop!

627
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,083
Miki!

628
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:39,268
Woman in a black wedding dress?

629
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:42,088
It wasn't me.

630
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:46,108
It must've been someone else.

631
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:50,096
Keisuke-san, why didn't you tell

632
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:52,068
Miki-san about all this sooner?

633
00:45:52,118 --> 00:45:56,085
But how could I explain that I'd fallen in love

634
00:45:56,155 --> 00:46:00,089
with someone who was identical to her?

635
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,043
- Identical?
Not quite.
- Hm?

636
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:08,197
When I saw her in Shinjuku I noticed
a mole near her mouth

637
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:12,267
But Miki-san didn't have one.

638
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:16,088
When he told me about what he'd seen

639
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:19,261
I realised we were dealing with two
different women.

640
00:46:19,311 --> 00:46:22,311
A mole...

641
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:29,202
I wonder why you never noticed.

642
00:46:32,174 --> 00:46:35,191
Perhaps you never really looked at her face.

643
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:39,261
Not Miki-san's, nor Hitomi-san's.

644
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:45,267
Both of you tortured Miki-san

645
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,090
and the woman in the black wedding dress

646
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,077
was Miki's vision of the monster that you created.

647
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,200
Do you really think she saw it? The
woman in a black wedding dress.

648
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:40,631
But the woman in this photo doesn't
have a mole either.

649
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:47,113
Do you think that's a real doppelganger?

650
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:50,132
And later Miki-san died.

651
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:54,153
So... this is a real urban legend?

652
00:47:54,223 --> 00:47:58,223
I guess we'll never really know.

653
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,015
I wish I'd met Miki

654
00:48:06,085 --> 00:48:11,270
while she was still alive.

1
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:33,855
If you write the name of the one you love on
an eraser they won't even look at anyone else.

2
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,911
So they'll fall in love with you?

3
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,829
But if someone else uses it: 
It's ruined.

4
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,796
So who is this Haruki person?

5
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,814
- It's a secret.
- A secret?

6
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:44,866
Anyone got an eraser?

7
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,885
May I?
Keeps your hands off it!

8
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:48,890
- Huh?
- What do you think you're doing?

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,859
That's her love charm.
If others use it

10
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,809
- the effect won't work.
- What bollocks.

11
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,847
- Give me that!
- No! No, I won't!

12
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:58,864
I hate youuuu!

13
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,802
Why are you crying?
Stop acting like a child!

14
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,839
As a cop, you obey your orders without question!

15
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,888
- What's going on here?

16
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,890
Assistant Commissioner!

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,927
Otonashi. 
Tannai.

18
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,122
I have something important to say.

19
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,752
Why couldn't the others stay?

20
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:25,807
Earlier a body was found.

21
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,844
In the National Diet Building.

22
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,846
In the Diet Building?

23
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,831
Hm.

24
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:37,886
On the eighth floor of the central tower.

25
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:41,840
But that's... 
the location of a famous urban myth.

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,846
Otonashi, 
don't talk about that in front of the 
Assistant Commissioner.

27
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,879
That's right, Tsukiko.

28
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:53,905
The hall on the eighth floor was once used
by the staff as a dance hall.

29
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:05,831
But, a couple who met there had a forbidden love

30
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:09,818
and the woman threw herself from the eighth floor.

31
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,510
It has been said that...

32
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,205
sometimes you can still hear her crying and...

33
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,076
the hall has not been used since.

34
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:21,424
But we went through the records and
 found no report of any suicide.

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,053
Perhaps they decided not to record
someone jumping from a government building.

36
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,986
Well... 
they'd record it somewhere...

37
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:30,556
But the most important thing is that...

38
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:34,029
there's a murder that involves an urban legend?

39
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,995
We have a suspect.

40
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:40,982
- Suspect?
- She called me directly.

41
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:44,089
Saying she'd killed someone and that she confesses.

42
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,139
The killer had your direct number?
Who was it?

43
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:51,976
Member of the government, Okusu Sakura.

44
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:57,015
That crazy one who wears a miniskirt?

45
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:01,086
- You're friends?
- In a manner of speaking.

46
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,922
I saw last night's "Debate Until Dawn".

47
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:09,532
You say you support the rights of working mothers
but you're from a political family.

48
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,245
What do you know of work?

49
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:14,215
I may not have any children myself but

50
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:17,271
I think I know as much about working
life as you do.

51
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,254
But, I once worked at a cabaret club.

52
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:23,224
And even now, I'm proud of the work I did.

53
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:27,265
It's this experience that helps me understand
 the wishes of the ordinary people.

54
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:34,202
Do the wishes of the ordinary people include
 seeing their politicians in miniskirts?

55
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,237
We represent the people!

56
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:40,224
And who decided I can't represent the people while
 showing a bit of leg!

57
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:44,228
It was such a cute skirt, I watched
the whole thing.

58
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:46,197
You idiot.

59
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,250
I'm totally behind Hana Oka's policies.

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,271
- Her earrings were nice, too.
- Cut that out!

61
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:58,242
That said, is this woman really a murderer?

62
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:03,231
That's the problem. 
There was something odd about her statement.

63
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:08,236
The ghost in the white dress...

64
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:12,256
It was because of the ghost in the white dress...

65
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:15,209
A ghost? 
Is that what she said?

66
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:19,163
Well, this is why I need to rely on your expertise.

67
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,233
Assistant Commissioner, excuse me for asking...

68
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,335
but are you serious...

69
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:26,843
about this being part of an urban myth?

70
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,229
Only me and some staff know about the confession

71
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:39,333
And we're trying to stop the story leaking out.

72
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:45,239
If you two took the case, 
I could have control of the mission

73
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:48,259
and I need you to work in secret.

74
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,266
- A mission.
- But you only have two days before we tell the press.

75
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:56,334
Forty-eight hours to find the truth.

76
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:58,404
Two days.

77
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:03,720
Otonashi, I'm putting you in charge.
 Tannai, I hope you'll co-operate.

78
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:08,246
She- she's in charge?

79
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,198
I can't!
I mean, I won't!

80
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,271
A policeman does not question the orders
of his superiors!

81
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,154
- Ah.
- Just one thing...

82
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:18,209
- What's that?
- If the eighth floor

83
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,225
really is haunted, then...

84
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,244
Then...?

85
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:26,264
I want you to promise it'll go public.

86
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,233
In an official statement from the police.

87
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:33,221
- That the crime was caused by an urban myth.
- Ah...

88
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,275
If it's true, or rather...
if it might be a bit true

89
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,247
We don't really need to make an announcement,
 do we?

90
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,195
No, you must.

91
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:47,385
Whether people believe or not, they
have a right to know the evidence.

92
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,455
What are you morons saying?

93
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,242
Sorry about that.

94
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,244
Okay.

95
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:01,282
If you can get cast-iron evidence
we'll publicize it.

96
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:03,251
I'll definitely find it!

97
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,324
The Diet Building's urban myth!

98
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:12,292
subs: ersby

99
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:19,320
raws: furransu

100
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,272
I haven't been here since I went on a school trip.

101
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:41,272
The National Diet Building is a special place.

102
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:44,345
There have been orders from up top
to restrict access.

103
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:47,328
Ordinary police can't investigate.

104
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:50,398
Hm? What's that?

105
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:57,405
He's been hanging on to it for a long time.

106
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:01,242
It a piece of old ribbon.

107
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:03,964
The victim is Honma Masahiro, 42.

108
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,214
He's a political reporter.

109
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:09,303
The estimated time of death was between
two and four o'clock today.

110
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:12,169
This place is usually off limits?

111
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:17,241
Yes, apart from once a year when it's used for
official events no one is allowed to enter.

112
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,264
The criminal is someone who knows
this building well.

113
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,233
Maybe it could be a politician?

114
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:25,269
With all this secrecy, I'd say that's a safe bet.

115
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,268
This is a difficult case.

116
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,224
Which is obviously why they asked me to take it.

117
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:33,361
I want details of everyone leaving and
entering the building today.

118
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,411
- Every last person.
- Sir!

119
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,215
Katsuura. 
Take that end.

120
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,251
Ah. Sure.

121
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,236
All together.

122
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:47,238
Huh?

123
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,278
What's up with him?

124
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,247
What are you doing?

125
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:59,216
Hey! What's happened?

126
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:02,353
Oi! Can you hear me?
Are you okay?

127
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:05,423
Snap out of it!
 Get a grip!

128
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,212
Ah, you'll be working under Gohara for this case.

129
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,281
Sir?

130
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,283
Okay.

131
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,218
What does this mean?

132
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,237
Everything I've worked for... 
over.

133
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:23,257
Is the team being disbanded?

134
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,243
What? Seriously?

135
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:30,214
- Let's go, Tannai-san.
- Yes.

136
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:33,234
Tannai-san, what's going on.

137
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,252
Don't ask me any questions.

138
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:37,338
- Tannai-san.
- Yes.

139
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,408
Tannai-san...

140
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,298
Officer Otonashi of the investigation team.

141
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,911
Officer Tannai of the investigation team.

142
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,419
Tannai-san, please.

143
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,274
I'll use these to make a barrier.

144
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,340
So you'll be perfectly safe in this room.

145
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,410
You can talk about anything.

146
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:07,351
You believe my story?

147
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,421
That's why I'm here.

148
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,244
Tannai-san, please put these in the four corners.

149
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:16,293
- Where?
- Up there.

150
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:19,363
And the sand too, please.

151
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,355
- Minister Okusu, if you please...
- No need to be so formal.

152
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,410
Well, then... 
Sakura-san.

153
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,316
- Ah. Other way round.
- Hm?

154
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,199
- They should face the other way.
- Oh, right.

155
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:49,656
Please tell me everything you remember
from that time.

156
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:54,215
I'd finished at a committee, and it
was about two o'clock.

157
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:57,284
I felt a tap on the shoulder

158
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,354
and I turned around.

159
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:08,179
The woman in white was on the ceiling?

160
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,282
Yes, and I could hear a waltz

161
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:15,252
I started to feel dizzy.

162
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,204
Waltz.

163
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:19,243
Like they'd use at a dance hall.

164
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:21,258
I must have used the stairs...

165
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:24,343
although I don't remember a thing, and then...

166
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:26,480
I was on the eighth floor...

167
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:33,588
with a dead man...
 right in front of me.

168
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:44,112
Assistant Commissioner?
 It's Okusu.
I think I just killed someone.

169
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,022
That's all I remember.

170
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:52,442
We found no fingerprints on the murder weapon.

171
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,926
Were you wearing gloves?

172
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:57,895
Do you remember wiping the weapon clean?

173
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:59,947
I don't know.

174
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,999
Where did the weapon come from?

175
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,919
- I don't know.
- Hm, it doesn't make sense.

176
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:06,904
Before you arrived at work

177
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:09,957
you must have been carrying the knife

178
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:13,027
- so that-
- It's not strange.

179
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:16,931
It might have been the work of the spirit.

180
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:21,018
Did you know Honma-san?

181
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:25,390
No... I didn't.

182
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,627
The problem is the woman in the white dress.

183
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:36,697
Why did she choose the two of you to be
 the victim and
 the criminal?

184
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:46,981
- I can't believe you're 
walking around government in that short skirt.
- They say investigating is mostly leg-work.

185
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:50,948
- Not that kind of leg-work.
- So this is Sakura-san's office.

186
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,951
I told you I couldn't stand it.

187
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:57,071
I'm sick of being that crazy woman's secretary.

188
00:11:57,141 --> 00:12:02,141
Now she's gone off somewhere.
She won't answer her calls.

189
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,081
I'll talk to you later.

190
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:09,168
How can I help?

191
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:15,059
I'm Officer Otonashi from the police.
This is my assistant, Tannai-san.

192
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,109
Assistant?
Officer Tannai.

193
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:22,980
Ah, this is Sakura-san's autobiography.

194
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,050
She looks great.

195
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,924
When I worked as a hostess I decided
to run for government.

196
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,959
I studied for a degree at evening classes

197
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,963
And I became a member of parliament for Tsuchiura
 in the Ibakari Prefecture.

198
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,912
Amazing.

199
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:39,931
May I take one?

200
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:43,951
Please.
 Why are the police here?

201
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,872
I heard a rumour about a murder
on the eighth floor.

202
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,941
Is it true?

203
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,388
It can't be...

204
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,945
Okusu-san is the victim?

205
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:55,880
No, nothing like that.

206
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,933
We're just taking witness statements.

207
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:02,954
Is that right. 
Well, Okusu-san is out at the moment.

208
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:04,872
And you are?

209
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:06,924
Her personal assistant, Nomoto.

210
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,851
Nomoto-san, can I ask you about...

211
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:14,018
the ghostly women in white on the eighth floor.

212
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,859
I think 
everyone who visits the Diet hears about that.

213
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,020
Absurd.

214
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,090
Just a ghost story.

215
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,914
- Minister Hana Oka!
- I'm Otonashi of the Investigation Team.

216
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:33,004
First a politician in a mini-skirt,
and now the police.

217
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:36,003
Sorry. 
I'm Tannai of the Investigation Team.

218
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:40,136
- Pleased to meet you, Officer Tannai.
- Pleased to meet you, too.

219
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,931
I hear there are reporting restrictions.
Is that true?

220
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:47,932
Something about a murder on the eighth floor?

221
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:51,005
- We are asking people to-
- Minister, do you know about

222
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:53,020
the ghost on the eighth floor?

223
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,939
Well... I've heard of it.

224
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:58,893
Of course you've heard of it!
It's a famous story, right?

225
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,964
Certainly, I've heard that stories
that anyone who went there

226
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:06,020
would be affected by the curse the next day.

227
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:10,905
But the curse of the eighth floor

228
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,959
has also been used to explain people's
defeats at elections.

229
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,862
Could it be that you've seen something?

230
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:21,949
No. But if it is real, it's a sad story.

231
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,953
All those years of not being able to rest in peace.

232
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:28,939
Definitely a tragic tale of love.

233
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,941
Minister Hana Oka

234
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:33,944
do you really believe such a silly story?

235
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:35,896
Of course.

236
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,933
But I admit I find living people more scary.

237
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,952
Especially politicians.

238
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:45,990
Minister, you words carry much weight.

239
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,965
If you want, please speak to Secretary Ikezoe.
He's like a walking encyclopedia for this area.

240
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,930
I see.

241
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,920
So there are people who think they've been
victims of the curse of the eighth floor.

242
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,968
It's just a rumour.

243
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:02,940
- By the way, is the other rumour true?
- Other rumour?

244
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,949
From the Diet Building to various places is
 a network of tunnels connected directly to
 the Prime Minister's office.

245
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,981
That other rumour.

246
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:12,950
Well, during the war.

247
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,870
They dug a tunnel to a bomb shelter.

248
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,939
Really? 
That's true?!

249
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,943
But it's all been filled in now.

250
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,880
But are you two really investigating

251
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,933
if this is the work of an old curse?

252
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,969
- Yes!
- Well, not really.

253
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,938
I thought as much.

254
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:37,044
Police wouldn't believe in old myths and legends.

255
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:41,094
Of course. 
She's the exception.

256
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,982
Well, I hope I've helped.

257
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,052
Thank you very much.

258
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,956
- Well, shall we go?
- Where?

259
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:55,960
To talk to the other victims of the curse.

260
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,912
No, I'm fine-

261
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:00,931
Hold it right there! 
You pests!

262
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,983
- What pests?
- Us?

263
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,953
You got Katsuura involved in all this.

264
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:07,905
Katsuura?

265
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:09,960
Because he follows you all the time
he's taking time off.

266
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,962
It must be because he's working so hard.

267
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,065
Has something happened to Katsuura?

268
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:35,933
- What the...?
- Ah, Tsukiko-san!

269
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,886
Could you put this picture straight for me?

270
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,923
- It's driving me mad.
- What happened to you?

271
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:46,944
I don't know. 
I was at the scene of the crime

272
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:50,948
and when I was about lift the body, I seized up.

273
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,938
Scene of the crime? 
You mean the hall on the eighth floor?

274
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:55,953
Yes. 
I heard a waltz and

275
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,939
then my back locked.

276
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,943
Waltz?
 You were hit by the curse?

277
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,946
Katsuura's a victim of the curse!

278
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,968
Don't say that.
You're scaring me.

279
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,950
Take this charm.

280
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,905
And this biography of Sakura Okusu.
It's pretty interesting.

281
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,924
Thanks.

282
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,964
By the way, was there anything interesting
at the crime scene?

283
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:21,946
- There was a ribbon.
- Ribbon?

284
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:23,934
The victim was clutching it in his hand.

285
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:27,968
It seemed quite old.
 Like from the post-war period.

286
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:29,970
Post-war?

287
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,960
That's right. 
That's when the hall was being used.

288
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,909
The time of the tragic couple.

289
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:38,963
Finally, it'll be announced.

290
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,985
- What announcement?
- Look out for the ceilings.

291
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:43,921
It seems the ghost in the white dress
can crawl across them.

292
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:48,022
- See ya!
- Are you trying to scare me?

293
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,092
It's completely unnecessary.

294
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:55,916
You can't identify everyone who entered
and left the building.

295
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:59,950
With around 700 members and then
journalists and staff

296
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,922
thousands of people come and go.
 No exact records are kept.

297
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,874
And surveillance cameras?

298
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:08,909
- There aren't any.
- What?!

299
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:13,013
Because there are so many guards present

300
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,985
they don't have any cameras in that area.

301
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:16,884
So that's how it is, huh?

302
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,924
- How do we proceed now?
- You're asking me how to proceed?

303
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,957
Get a statement from all the staff!

304
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,960
Why am I stuck with Tannai's team?

305
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,896
- I feel like I'm missing out.
- Tannai-san!

306
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,951
Tannai-san is nothing to do with this
investigation.

307
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:32,950
- Let's go, Watanabe.

308
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,970
Please do.

309
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,989
I feel so tired these days.

310
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,943
- Tannai-san, may I have a word?
- Sure.

311
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:45,913
Are you working on the same case as us?

312
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,983
Sorry, but I can't talk about that.

313
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,952
Why is it you and Otonashi?

314
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:55,940
Is it because we're friends that
I was taken off your team?

315
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,942
That's not why, Shibayama.

316
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,962
Good.
Since you think that way

317
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,915
I feel like I can tell you what we've found

318
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:07,935
in our investigation.

319
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:13,978
We discovered that shortly before the incident,
the victim and suspect were seen in a corridor 
having a quarrel.

320
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,909
Give me a break!

321
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,982
Who are you to stick your nose in?!

322
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,915
She seemed to be very aggressive and threatening.

323
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,934
Sakura Okusu?

324
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:26,003
And there's this.

325
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:30,073
Details about the victim, Honma.

326
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:34,263
Shibayama.

327
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:36,113
Thanks.

328
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,936
Your secretary, Nomoto-san, was looking for you.

329
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:46,904
He can't be trusted.
 He was assigned randomly.

330
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,890
And we've never got along.

331
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,997
Your attitude and your miniskirt?

332
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,914
- Yep.
- I was reading

333
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:00,901
Your book "Yankee girl in a miniskirt
goes to government!"

334
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:04,905
You've had an amazing life!

335
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,926
I found out I was adopted in high school.

336
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:12,997
I fell out with my parents and things
started going downhill.

337
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,805
But you tried hard and...

338
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:17,264
paid your way through night school...

339
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,020
with money from your work in bars.

340
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,090
I wanted to meet my biological parents
who had left me.

341
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:31,899
But I could never trace them.

342
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,934
So you became a politician?

343
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:37,942
Because the coverage of political debates
is shown all over the country.

344
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:40,991
Oh, about the incident on the eighth floor.

345
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:45,061
We have some evidence connecting it to the ghost.

346
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:52,084
It seems to have been produced soon after the war

347
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:56,924
Sakura-san?

348
00:20:56,994 --> 00:21:02,046
Where... did you find this?

349
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:05,116
Honma-san was holding it when he died.

350
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,954
Sakura-san.

351
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:13,024
Do you recognise this ribbon?

352
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,161
(knock)

353
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:19,914
What is it?

354
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:24,989
Before the incident you were seen arguing with 
Honma.

355
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,940
You said you didn't know him...

356
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,928
- but that was a lie.
- Tannai-san.

357
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:38,832
Using the ghost story to hide your guilt,
was that the plan?

358
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:41,886
What are you saying, Tannai-san?

359
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:46,924
Honma was a gambler who ran up debts.

360
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:49,910
Needing money, he dug into your past.

361
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,899
- Isn't that right?
- Tannai-san!

362
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:58,088
Using the ghost story as an alibi?
I hate people who lie!

363
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,941
- Well...?
- Come here, please.

364
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,876
- Hey, get off me!

365
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:08,929
- What are you doing?
- Get off!

366
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,986
I'm doing my job by the book, and 
I haven't seen much of the Assistant Commissioner.

367
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:14,001
- Shh!
- Why? 
What for?

368
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,071
People can hear.

369
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:20,908
Keep your voice down.

370
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:22,910
Only twenty-four hours.

371
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,030
Let's go somewhere where we can't be overheard.

372
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Fine by me.
 Let's go.

373
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:34,922
I guess we can't be overheard, but I
wasn't expecting this...

374
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:36,874
Why did she bring me up here?

375
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:38,943
Sorry to keep you-

376
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:40,978
Why are you being so formal?

377
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:44,848
- Let's get this over with.
- Why are you whispering?

378
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:46,884
I'm not whispering.

379
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,939
- You want to talk about something?
- What?

380
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:51,939
Don't "what" me. 
Aren't you a bit close?

381
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,908
- I'm home.
- Ah! Excuse me!

382
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,927
Sorry for interrupting?

383
00:22:56,997 --> 00:22:58,949
You're not interrupting.
 I'm the one who should apologise.

384
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,902
- I can leave if it's important.
- Well, it's confidential, but

385
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:03,937
- I guess it's okay, Miyako.
- Of course.

386
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:06,003
Feel free to stay.

387
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:09,386
- In that case, I'll make some tea.
- I'm fine thanks.

388
00:23:10,994 --> 00:23:13,927
I wonder if they had met before.

389
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:17,948
- Who met who?
- The people from the eighth floor.

390
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,954
Of course they did! 
What kind of drivel is this?

391
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,936
Ah, excuse me.

392
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:24,905
I'm not really angry.

393
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:27,945
- This is just how I discuss work.
- Don't worry.

394
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:33,914
If you want to know my theory about Sakura-san...

395
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:37,901
She must have a motive. 
Perhaps she's hiding something.

396
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:40,971
- But...
- No buts.

397
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:45,926
Either someone made Sakura look like the killer.
 This is a possibility.

398
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:49,917
But it could be that Sakura is the killer. 
That's the only other option.

399
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,965
But you don't know for sure.

400
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:53,817
But it must be right.

401
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:58,909
If there's the faintest of faint chances that the
evidence points to the myth, we'll have to say

402
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:03,961
"This time the murderer... 
was a ghost."

403
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:07,931
I can't let something so dumb go out as an
official statement.

404
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,953
Sorry. 
I didn't mean to sound angry.

405
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,919
- It's just shop talk.

406
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:14,021
- Please. 
Enjoy your tea.

407
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:17,091
When did you put that there?

408
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,937
Huh? What's this?

409
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:33,090
Ah? Again?

410
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Waltz? You were hit by the curse?

411
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:43,003
Huh?

412
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:05,873
Ah! Must be careful!

413
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,928
I can't hear it!
I can't hear it! 
I can't hear any music!

414
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,083
Huh?

415
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:30,081
Why?

416
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,942
I refuse to recognise such a thing.

417
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:40,908
- What's that?
- Good morning!

418
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:42,963
Katsuura! 
What are you doing here?

419
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:46,029
I'm here to lend you a hand.

420
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,099
Eh?

421
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:53,025
Take a look at this picture.

422
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:57,882
- Isn't that Minister Oka?
- Do you mind if I...?

423
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,949
I did a search on many politicians yesterday

424
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,019
and this is what I found.

425
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:08,873
That ribbon!

426
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,859
It's the same one that Honma-san was holding!

427
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:13,995
That's not all.

428
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:16,065
What's wrong?

429
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,036
Also here

430
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:27,878
No doubt about it.
 The same one.

431
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:30,945
Why would these two woman have the same ribbon?

432
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:35,015
Perhaps Minister Oka is also a suspect?

433
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:44,859
Let's go, Tannai-san.

434
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:46,894
Good luck!

435
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:52,174
- I'm busy from ten o'clock this morning so
 please be brief. 
- In that case I'll get to the point.

436
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,151
Do you recognise this?

437
00:26:56,941 --> 00:27:00,875
This was made in a Kimono shop just after the war

438
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,860
so it's pretty rare.

439
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,763
Ministers have many costumes given to them.

440
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,886
They can't be expected to remember a single ribbon.

441
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:13,955
By the way, at the time Honma-san was murdered
the day before yesterday between two and four

442
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:17,025
where were you?

443
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,178
At one o'clock I went to the Prime
Minister's office.

444
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:28,939
From two until three she gave a
harp recital for visiting dignitaries.

445
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,871
I was there, too.

446
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:49,874
After that, we had a meal with the guests.

447
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:54,799
So on the day of the murder you spent the
whole afternoon at the Prime Minister's office?

448
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:56,864
Until the evening.

449
00:27:56,934 --> 00:28:01,986
- Can you prove that?
- I don't understand you at all.

450
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:08,056
The Prime Minister's office. You can't just
walk in and out, you have to go through security.

451
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:14,965
Minister Oka's alibi seems solid.

452
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:18,035
Maybe the ribbon thing is just a coincidence.

453
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:30,981
No, her alibi hasn't been checked yet.

454
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:37,872
Takeshi, dear. 
I mean... Assistant Commissioner.

455
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:41,861
The secret tunnel between the Prime
Minister's office and the Diet Building

456
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,879
You've heard about this?

457
00:28:44,949 --> 00:28:46,797
Well, yes.

458
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,850
In 1960, when the US-Japan treaty was signed

459
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,494
the were huge demonstrations and

460
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:57,858
the Prime Minister tried to
escape by using these tunnels.

461
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:00,861
But didn't you say they'd been filled in?

462
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:05,766
Well, that's what the rumours said

463
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:08,819
but it seems that parts of the tunnel remained.

464
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:11,939
- Really?
- But where they go...

465
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:15,259
- I really have no idea.
- Please let me investigate.

466
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,880
If the Diet Building and the PM's office are 
connected by a tunnel

467
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,919
that'd be about 400 metres in a straight line
then you can do a round trip in ten minutes.

468
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:30,957
Without leaving any record of having left the
office, Minister Oka's alibi is not confirmed.

469
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:36,029
Hm, perhaps it's a little weakened.

470
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,958
Good old Takeshi, dear.

471
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:51,278
Don't call him that. 
He's the Assistant Commissioner.

472
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,959
- That stinks.
- It really does.

473
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:07,029
- Smells acidic.

474
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,763
Wow... 
this is great.

475
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:13,818
Where is this place?
The stench is overwhelming.

476
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:16,937
What's this?!

477
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,007
Suspicious.

478
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,930
- There's a door here.
- There is.

479
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:26,951
Should you touch it?
It's all sealed up.

480
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:30,001
Aaggh!

481
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:35,956
(sound of wind)

482
00:30:36,026 --> 00:30:40,026
Tannai-san, this must be the tunnel.

483
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:43,998
Wow. 
This place is amazing.

484
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:52,273
- I have a weird feeling about this.
- Hm? Like what?

485
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:54,959
Is that a uniform?

486
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,029
Is it armour?

487
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,603
Now I think about it,

488
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:03,384
this area did belong to the old Nabeshima clan.

489
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:05,836
Home to the devil cat, Bakeneko.

490
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:10,925
What's that?

491
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,077
Why has it suddenly gone cold?

492
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:16,934
Let's keep going.

493
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:23,938
To be honest, I didn't really want to come here.

494
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:28,929
But if it means uncovering an urban
myth, I guess I have to.

495
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:34,848
I already hate this place.

496
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:38,869
The blood of the people who created modern Japan
flowed through here.

497
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,792
There's also a ghost in
 the Prime Minister's Office.

498
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:45,876
One Prime Minister is amongst the
people who've witnessed it.

499
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:51,865
They say it's a soldier from the
February 26th Incident.

500
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:53,169
You can hear...

501
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,870
his footsteps marching before he appears.

502
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,957
(footsteps)

503
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:01,945
Like that...

504
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:19,025
An real urban myth... it's here!

505
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,049
What's this?

506
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,069
A foot!

507
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:31,972
- Otonashi. 
Hold this, please.
- Yes.

508
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:35,042
Huh? What's that over there?

509
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,108
Aaagh! 
Aagh!

510
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,085
Ooh, my god!!

511
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,025
It's okay.

512
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,847
Nomoto-san.

513
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:17,918
He can't be trusted. 
He was assigned randomly.

514
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:19,957
And we've never got along.

515
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:31,882
What the? 
Where am I?

516
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,884
Where were you hiding?

517
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:38,889
I'm tired. 
Maybe I should resign.

518
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:42,876
Prime Minister! 
How can you be so weak at a time like this?

519
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:47,998
The PM? So this is the real thing.

520
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,068
I've got to the Prime Minister's Office!

521
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:56,023
Hm? This is...

522
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:19,880
Why are we dressed like this?

523
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,867
To gain favour with the spirits living here.

524
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,869
Is this fancy dress?

525
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,891
- What's going on.
- Assistant Commissioner.

526
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,976
This is a mark of respect for the spirits.

527
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:39,046
Ah... so you were able to find prove that
 the spirits exist?

528
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:44,888
Sakura-san. 
I believe what you told me

529
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:48,926
the legend about the ghosts putting a curse
on this hall

530
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:50,996
we looked into it.

531
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:54,882
The victim was holding on to this old ribbon

532
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:57,905
and I thought this was proof the spirits
were involved.

533
00:34:57,955 --> 00:35:00,771
But I was wrong.

534
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:05,893
Thirty years ago, a woman cried for her lost love

535
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:09,880
and this was an important link.

536
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,885
Officer, we're terribly busy, so...

537
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:16,177
Minister Oka.

538
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,997
Thirty years ago,

539
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:23,844
you lost a loved one in an accident.

540
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,864
What does that have to do with anything?

541
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:31,018
Well... quite a lot.

542
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,088
Isn't that so, Ikezoe-san?

543
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:39,860
Pardon me while I explain.

544
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,815
The Oka dynasty produces generations
of politicians,

545
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:47,868
the best of the best,

546
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:52,856
but one day

547
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:57,861
you met a poor man and fell in love.

548
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:03,917
So you decide to marry against your family's wishes.

549
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:06,954
You were already pregnant

550
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:11,875
with that man's child

551
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:16,847
but he died suddenly.

552
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:21,869
In shock, you were taken to hospital

553
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:27,858
where you gave birth prematurely.

554
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:31,879
And remained there, barely conscious.

555
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:35,866
When you regained your senses

556
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:38,986
the child had already been put up for adoption

557
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:41,119
and the whereabouts were unknown.

558
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:47,844
This is what's best for the child.

559
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:53,951
I given the child a ribbon, just like
the one you own.

560
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:58,021
It was a girl.

561
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:07,898
Sakura-san, don't you have a ribbon like this?

562
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,970
Could it be?

563
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Sakura-san is your daughter.

564
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,888
Honma was a gambler and deep in debt.

565
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,959
When he discovered this, he thought it'd
make him rich.

566
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:38,829
A minister who was changing parental support

567
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:41,982
but had given up a child of her own?

568
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,052
Sounds like a chance for blackmail.

569
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:51,942
Sakura-san, on that day the person who
tapped your shoulder

570
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:56,012
wasn't the ghost, but rather Honma-san.

571
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:02,903
Minister. 
Do you want to meet your real parents?

572
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:05,022
Huh?

573
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:09,092
There's a woman with the same ribbon as you:
 your mother.

574
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
I don't want to know.

575
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:17,951
Huh? Perhaps you already know

576
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:20,084
the identity of your real mother.

577
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:25,829
Then let's do this story now: 
the meeting of long-lost mother and child.

578
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:28,882
I'll be in the hall on the eighth floor at three.
 I've also called your mother.

579
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,865
There'll be no one there to interrupt us.

580
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,867
Give me a break!

581
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,871
Who are you to stick your nose in?!

582
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:42,893
But it the end, you did come here.

583
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:46,950
And you discovered the body of Honma-san.

584
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,876
Assistant Commissioner?
 It's Osuku.

585
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,862
I've just killed a man.

586
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:04,000
You really thought you knew who did it:

587
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:12,859
The person who killed Honma-san was your real mother
which is why you gave yourself up to the police.

588
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:18,945
You couldn't think of a real motive so you blamed
it all on the legend of the spirit in white.

589
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:22,015
But you were wrong.

590
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:35,596
But you were wrong.

591
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:42,818
Earlier we found the tunnel

592
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:45,888
from the PM's office to the Diet Building.

593
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:50,726
At the exit, I saw there was a surveillance camera

594
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:54,814
We checked the footage and saw

595
00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:57,884
Ikezoe-san leaving the building.

596
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:26,829
You're not the person I'm expecting.

597
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:29,962
And when those two people meet, what will you do?

598
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,705
This ribbon was found in Minister Oka's office.

599
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:41,644
This is evidence that the minister abandoned her
 only child, right?

600
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:45,731
I could sell this for a high price on the market.

601
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:47,733
- Give it back!
- Get off me!

602
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:50,303
This is too important to leave to you...

603
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:58,727
Give it back!

604
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:02,782
I'd have given it to you for money...

605
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:04,917
Give it to me!

606
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:08,987
Wife... 
child... 
money

607
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:17,746
Can this really be true?

608
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:22,751
Earlier I found the body of Nomoto-san.

609
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:25,821
My secretary?

610
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:30,891
This was your handiwork too, wasn't it?

611
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:40,786
Nomoto-san found out everything
and threatened to go to the police.

612
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,775
- We can't keep this secret.
- Please don't!

613
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:45,758
- This'll finish off Minister Oka too!

614
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,913
Stop! 
Stop that!

615
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:58,737
I hid the body in the tunnel.

616
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,640
What are you saying?

617
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,744
I beg your forgiveness.

618
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:10,766
It's all my fault.

619
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:19,808
I was the one who separated them thirty years ago!

620
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,878
I'm sorry.

621
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:40,894
But there's one thing I don't understand.

622
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:48,885
Why make the confession?
To protect a mother who'd left you?

623
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:58,180
When I turned twenty

624
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:04,269
My foster parents told me the name
of my real mother.

625
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:07,339
I hated her.

626
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:12,294
Right up until the end of that televised debate.

627
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:16,364
- Thank you.
- Thanks for your hard work.

628
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,186
The newbie politician is a feisty one.

629
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:24,342
What did you have to do to get chosen by the party.

630
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:28,892
Women have it easy, they can just
 turn on the charm.

631
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:34,182
Don't worry about people like that,

632
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:36,151
Minister...

633
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:40,322
When I was young, 
I'd let myself get upset by those types.

634
00:43:40,392 --> 00:43:44,392
You remind me of my younger self.

635
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,350
Let's be best of enemies.

636
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,481
Surprisingly,

637
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:08,381
those feelings I had until then just disappeared.

638
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:20,312
- I'm sorry-
- Please don't, minister.

639
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:23,382
Apologies don't suit you.

640
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:34,322
But I'm not a minister any more.

641
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:39,164
Ikezoe's sins are my sins, too.

642
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:43,301
I will resign.

643
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:50,371
I hope one day you return to government.

644
00:44:54,349 --> 00:45:01,349
So that we can fight each other as politicians.

645
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:44,162
Why don't I take over from here.

646
00:45:44,232 --> 00:45:46,214
Of course.

647
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:52,187
You already knew, didn't you?
What really happened.

648
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,433
Well...

649
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:58,159
it's difficult to do police work in the 
Diet Building.

650
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:01,199
A legitimate investigation would
never get far, in my opinion.

651
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:05,300
So I thought Otonashi's style
might get things moving.

652
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:09,370
I won't forgive you.
 For putting the blame onto a legend.

653
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,191
Don't say such lies again.

654
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:17,212
I mean it. 
One hundred percent.

655
00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:19,264
Sorry.

656
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:26,187
It's a shame, but it seems 
you won't be getting that announcement you wanted.

657
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:29,190
One day soon, I'll prove one exists!

658
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,260
You don't need to salute.

659
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,330
Come one. 
Let's go.

660
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:40,272
Assistant Commissioner, 
does this mean I'm no longer Otonashi's assistant?

661
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:42,322
That's right.

662
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,212
The secretary of Minister Oka has been arrested.

663
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,194
No motive has been given.

664
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,247
Funny that it should end like this.

665
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:54,202
The story's a lot smaller than you'd expect.

666
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:57,185
Do you think he's covering for someone else?

667
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:59,204
- Eh?
- I heard that too.

668
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,260
That this conspiracy involves the
government somehow.

669
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,176
You know, this is just gossip but

670
00:47:05,246 --> 00:47:09,197
- I heard that the real killer is an alien.
- Eh?

671
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:12,167
Tannai's team... 
bunch of idiots, right?

672
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:14,219
- Let's go, Watanabe.
- Sir!

673
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,258
But if the safety of all society is in danger...

674
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:19,308
Don't give me that crap!

675
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:23,214
But it's true that 
the government is hiding something about this case.

676
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:25,196
The government?

677
00:47:25,266 --> 00:47:28,236
Now I get it.
 This is how urban legends are born.

678
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:32,203
Now we're back together,
are we able to do our jobs?

679
00:47:32,273 --> 00:47:36,191
Of course. 
We're not just here because we're friends.

680
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:38,276
Tannai-san...

681
00:47:38,346 --> 00:47:41,346
- Come here.
- Yes!

682
00:47:43,268 --> 00:47:45,166
Are you feeling okay?

683
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:48,153
Yes, and I've stopped hearing those waltzes.

684
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,172
- But.
- But?

685
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:55,176
- Now it's Enka music.
- Enka?

686
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:58,179
Ah! I can hear it again!

687
00:47:58,249 --> 00:48:02,220
Katsuura, it seems you got a bit obsessed with
 the ghost while in hospital.

688
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,105
But what should I do, Tsukiko-san?

689
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:08,176
Well, it doesn't seem to be an evil
spirit. Perhaps you'll get used to it.

690
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:10,191
Enka and ghosts.

691
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:13,261
Ah, I have to be somewhere!

692
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:15,331
But wait!

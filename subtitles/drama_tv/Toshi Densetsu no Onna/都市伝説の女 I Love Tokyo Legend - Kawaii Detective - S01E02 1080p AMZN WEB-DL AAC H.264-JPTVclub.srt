1
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,468
Agh!

2
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,614
Wow!

3
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,766
What's wrong?

4
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:03,902
It's some kind of snake! 
There!

5
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:06,572
Ah, just there?

6
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:12,180
So the reason you're late is because 
you stopped to take a photo.

7
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,347
If I hadn't, I would never have got another chance.

8
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:21,417
See for yourself. 
The legendary creature Tsuchinoko.

9
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,193
- It's a snake.
- Yeah, that's a snake.

10
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:28,964
Although we cannot be sure from the photo, but
 it definitely isn't a snake.

11
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,032
- It is a snake.
- That's a snake all right.

12
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,898
- Yes, it is.

13
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,966
Well, believe me or not.

14
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:38,036
It's one more clue about an urban myth.

15
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,994
- Something happened?
- Huh?

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,980
Hello? 
Yes... 
I understand.

17
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,425
A woman's body has been discovered in
Setagaya mansion.

18
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:55,938
subs: ersby

19
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,502
thanks to: onctom (timing)
furransu (raws)

20
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:20,526
Look at this.

21
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,548
This property is pretty impressive.

22
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,650
In the past, the local Daimyo lived here.

23
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
- Really.
- Must be hell to clean, though.

24
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,693
Ah.

25
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,589
Otonashi! 
What are you doing!

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,716
Let's go!

27
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:49,741
Her name was Kuroiwa Fukuko, 61. 
Died due to a blow to the back of the head.

28
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,811
We estimate the time of death as being
between ten and twelve yesterday evening.

29
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,710
This is the weapon?

30
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,632
When the housekeeper came to see her in the morning

31
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,682
that's when the body was found.

32
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:02,504
Excuse me. 
My lady?

33
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,690
My - Aagh!

34
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:11,610
And what's this?

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
What's she got in her hand?

36
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:24,823
It's an amazing collection.

37
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:28,897
Isn't it. 
But this collector didn't keep his collection in
 the right manner.

38
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:31,833
The way these are arranged...
it's a complete mess!

39
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:33,835
Huh? Katsuura, is something bothering you?

40
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,834
Me?
 No, not at all.

41
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,990
- You seem a bit angry.
- No, I'm fine. Really.

42
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,978
- Very angry, in fact...
- I'm not angry.
 No no.

43
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:47,829
Ah, you're at it again.

44
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:50,936
I just tidied up a bit.
Please don't tell my boss.

45
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:53,986
Ah? Who called Tannai and his team?

46
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,845
Was she one of the wealthiest in this area?

47
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:03,862
Yes. 
After her husband died, she ran the business and -

48
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:08,834
Tannai, why don't you take a good look
around the garden?

49
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:11,857
- Are we in your way?
- Not at all. 
But maybe the criminal left something...

50
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,842
Gohara-san has a point. 
Let's go.

51
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:15,874
If you don't mind.

52
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:17,726
Is this sash tie a diamond?

53
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:19,811
That's right, Tsukiko.

54
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,850
I wonder why she was holding on to it.

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,819
Perhaps it's the reason she was attacked.

56
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:25,887
Why not take it after she's dead?

57
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,923
None of the other valuables have been
touched, either.

58
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,741
This crime is nothing to do with theft.

59
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,843
Yes, of course you're right. 
And the family?

60
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:33,862
Why don't you talk to the family yourself?

61
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:35,964
Just stay out of my way and do your job.

62
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,014
I understand. 
Of course.

63
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:45,972
This red glow!

64
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:49,808
Could it be...?

65
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,793
- Huh?
- Huh?

66
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,849
Is this a fragment of the Hope Diamond?

67
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,797
The what diamond?

68
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,899
Hope Diamond.

69
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,969
It's a famous diamond that carries a curse.

70
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,809
This incident is based on an urban legend!

71
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,897
Let's go, Shibayama.

72
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,967
Watanabe!
 Round up the family. 
And the staff.

73
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,873
A cursed diamond.

74
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:23,943
You want to know more?

75
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:27,046
In that case...

76
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,987
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

77
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:40,859
Dai-san, you say you were in Roppongi, drinking.

78
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:43,845
- Yep.
- Until around what time?

79
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:46,815
I don't remember.
 I was too drunk.

80
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,817
I see.

81
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:51,873
Sei-san. 
You were in the house the whole time?

82
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:56,725
- Well...
- Yes.

83
00:05:56,795 --> 00:06:01,813
At around midnight I brought a snack to his room.

84
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,852
But you didn't see him before then.

85
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,917
That's right.

86
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:07,987
Kou-san?

87
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,823
I was studying in my room the whole time.

88
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:15,744
I didn't see anyone that evening.

89
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:18,897
Dai, Kou and Sei-san...

90
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:23,819
That means "great success". 
Their parents must have liked puns.

91
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,807
Really, none of them have a good alibi.

92
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:27,823
Not even the two staff.

93
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,859
No sign of forced entry.

94
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,931
I'm sure the killer is one of these five.

95
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:37,981
Ah, I have to go.
 I have to deal with mother's property.

96
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,820
Huh? Who are you?

97
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,825
Otonashi of the investigation team.

98
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:50,712
- My condolences.
- Is that right?
 A policewoman?

99
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,851
Is there something you want to ask?

100
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:55,917
About the diamond that you mother was holding

101
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:57,987
did you know it was cursed?

102
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,810
Huh? That's ridiculous.

103
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,864
My mother cherished that diamond for many years.

104
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,899
Idiot child!

105
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,834
Hey...!

106
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:16,855
Even when I'm dead, you're not
laying a finger on this diamond.

107
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:21,827
I think she just wanted to hang
on to it til the very end.

108
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,765
Don't talk like that, Dai-san.

109
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:27,933
Anyway, this has messed up my work life, so
 if you'll excuse me.

110
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:30,003
Until we meet again.

111
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,973
If you remember anything at all, give me a call.

112
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,969
Hm.

113
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,758
I'm starting to feel tired. 
Can I go to my room now?

114
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:53,808
Of course.
 I'll bring your meal up later.

115
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:55,827
Thanks.

116
00:07:55,897 --> 00:07:57,913
- Ah!

117
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,983
Be careful. 
Are you all right?
Hold on to me.

118
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,819
Is your brother ill?

119
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,807
Not really. 
He just spends a lot of time in his room.

120
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:10,725
We'll talk again later.

121
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,811
Tannai-san!

122
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:16,831
Just keep doing that until after I've gone, okay?

123
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:21,820
Tsukiko. 
Could you make sure Forensics get this.

124
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,872
- Let's go, Watanabe.
- Sir!

125
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:25,942
I'll search upstairs.

126
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,813
Are you okay?

127
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:33,782
This is all a bit sudden.

128
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,818
Why would such a thing happen to mother?

129
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:40,822
Perhaps...
it's because this diamond has a curse?

130
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:42,824
Otonashi! 
Cut it out!

131
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:46,861
Actually, it is well known that this blue
diamond is cursed.

132
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,713
Oi!

133
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,752
Do you want to ask me about the curse?

134
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,817
Do you know about it?!

135
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,839
I read about it when I studied Western History.

136
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:58,873
So you know the story about it.

137
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:02,827
After King Louis XV received it, he
died of smallpox.

138
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:08,833
Louis XVI inherited it and he and Marie Antoinette
we both executed in the French Revolution.

139
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,903
Perhaps because of this diamond.

140
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,842
- What a load of drivel.
- It's just superstition.

141
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:17,846
And also Mine Fujiko from "Lupin III" is said
to be under the effects of the curse.

142
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:20,895
- What? 
Mine Fujiko?
- Really?

143
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:23,832
- Shibayama! Don't be fooled!
- Sir!

144
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:27,806
Certainly, 
during the time of the French Revolution
 it was stolen

145
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:32,807
and when it was finally found again
it was now smaller than it was before.

146
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:34,809
It's currently in America

147
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,812
held by the Smithosian museum who say

148
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,831
the diamond has only 45 carats.

149
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,801
The rest was probably cut away and sold off.

150
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:46,821
So you think my mother's diamond is one
of those pieces?

151
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,808
The Hope Diamond is usually blue

152
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:54,933
but when ultra violet light shines on it, 
it turns red

153
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:03,822
See?
 It's red.

154
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,824
So it is.

155
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:08,860
But the legend of the curse

156
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,912
Was invented by a jeweller.

157
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:14,982
- You know a lot about the curse!
- So do you.

158
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,786
Well, I've finished my search.

159
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,874
If we're pulling out, what do you need me to do?

160
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,924
When the curse was placed...

161
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,943
Hey!

162
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:27,013
Who's there?

163
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,967
- Shibayama, quick!
- Sir!

164
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:36,921
I knew it.
 It's the curse.

165
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,991
Your mother may have died due to the power
of this diamond.

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,812
Really?

167
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:45,850
Hey, do you mind! 
No need to keep holding her.

168
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,953
- Sorry.
- Thank you very much.

169
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,821
I hope master is not hurt.

170
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,807
Who put that thing right on the window ledge?

171
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:57,796
Excuse me. I'll be more careful in future.

172
00:10:57,846 --> 00:11:00,712
Satomi!
 Satomi!

173
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,914
- Yes.
- Come here.

174
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:04,984
- Clean this up, quickly.

175
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:09,738
- Sorry.
- That's fine...

176
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:12,841
But I don't think it was the diamond.

177
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:16,811
Mother always said this diamond brought luck.

178
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:19,831
It can't have been cursed.

179
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:23,855
Since we received it, our family
became richer and more powerful.

180
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:27,842
About the property you wanted, I think we can
come to some agreement.

181
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:32,811
Heh heh heh.
Looks like I'm about to close the deal, right?

182
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,930
You really like that sash tie.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is my good luck charm.

184
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:45,807
When I die, I'm passing this on to you.

185
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:50,402
- It looks like you were your mother's favourite.
- Huh?

186
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,935
Dai-san said that 
he was told he'd never get the diamond.

187
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:56,918
She's told us that since we were children.

188
00:11:56,988 --> 00:12:02,988
Mother really cared for me.

189
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,824
I just got back from Forensics.

190
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,857
Did they get any fingerprints from the weapon?

191
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,890
Only from the family and the staff.

192
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,745
Something stinks about Dai-san.

193
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,832
Is that intuition based on
all your years of experience?

194
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:26,250
Lately, he's been complaining about all
his years of experience.

195
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,832
Kisama.

196
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,888
- There's no need for that, right Shibayama?
- Of course.

197
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:33,842
Let's track down the criminal and arrest him before
 Gohara-san can get to him.

198
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:37,862
Okay, let's go. 
First, check the eldest son's actions for that day.

199
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,811
Okay, okay, let's go to work.

200
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,946
- Just one "okay" is enough.

201
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:44,016
- Otonashi. 
We're going.
- Okay.

202
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,976
Without you.

203
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:59,981
I have to find out how they got that diamond.

204
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:09,974
Hello. 
I'm glad you called, Dai-san.

205
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:18,982
Okay.
 I'm looking forward to it.

206
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:23,821
Is that a date? 
Perhaps with that Kou-san?

207
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,840
How's the case going?

208
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,810
Sure, he's good looking, easy to talk to,

209
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,830
and he did save your life, so he can't be all bad.

210
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,837
I get the feeling that the truth about
the diamond is somewhere in that house.

211
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,852
Anyway, nobody would suspect

212
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:40,805
- someone like him.
- That's not true.

213
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,807
Hm?

214
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:48,913
The thing about the curse is that
it leads people to do all kinds of terrible things.

215
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:52,983
Even nice people can't resist its power.

216
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,958
So, you think that even Kou-san could've
committed the crime?

217
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,008
I think any of them could have.

218
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,830
But the real criminal is

219
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,834
the diamond that she had been holding.

220
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:11,739
Tsukiko-san. 
Let's prove this curse together.

221
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:14,826
But investigating makes me hungry.
Let's get some food?

222
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:17,879
- Ah, sorry. 
Prior engagement.
- Oh.

223
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:25,833
I'm only allowed to claim about
10,000 yen in expenses.

224
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,802
This place may be a little...

225
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,821
It's on me. 
Of course.

226
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,844
That's a bit awkward... 
since this is police work.

227
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:34,742
Well, I won't tell anyone.

228
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:39,847
So, you wanted to talk about the diamond?

229
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,886
Ah...

230
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:49,841
So, you were saying about your mother's diamond?

231
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:52,827
Mm. My father received it as a gift.

232
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:57,902
Soon after that, he set up in business and 
mother became pregnant with me.

233
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,917
So it does bring good luck.

234
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,840
Unfortunately, my father died before I was born.

235
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,841
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

236
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:10,832
But my mother quickly found another husband 
that could run the business.

237
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:12,780
Soon after that, Sei was born.

238
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,749
More good luck.

239
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:16,834
And he died in an accident.

240
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:18,836
He died too? 
So, Kou-san...?

241
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,842
He was the son of her third husband.

242
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:23,875
And, again, the third husband died.

243
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:28,945
And each time a husband died, your wealth increased.

244
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:31,816
It must be the curse.

245
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:35,887
Do you know exactly where the diamond came from?

246
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:41,957
Well, I've heard that it came from my
uncle who bought it.

247
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:46,851
Kuroiwa-san. 
Would you mind coming with me, please.

248
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:49,884
- Eh?
- Gohara-san. 
Why?

249
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:53,821
Some things have come to light that involve him.

250
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:56,824
At the Roppongi club.

251
00:15:56,894 --> 00:16:00,845
Watch out, Mother.
 I'm going to kill you.
Kill you!

252
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,815
Damn you, mother.
You're going to die!

253
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,733
Ah, no...
I was just drunk.

254
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,786
And you left the club at nine o'clock.

255
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,843
That leaves you enough time to go home
and commit the crime.

256
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:14,879
You've got it all wrong.
After then I went to another place.

257
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,811
Which other place?

258
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,866
I don't recall... 
I was drunk...

259
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,852
Either way, you're coming with us.

260
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:22,834
- But...
- Sorry.

261
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:24,872
Quick, call my brother Kou. 
He can get me a lawyer.

262
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,958
About the diamond, you'll need to find my uncle Masuzawa.

263
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:30,008
Uncle Masuzawa?

264
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:33,811
What? 
Gohara arrested Dai-san?

265
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,830
Is that true?

266
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,832
- Hello.
- "It's Otonashi."

267
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:40,922
"My sister was dumped by her boyfriend
and I'm looking after her."

268
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,820
Huh?

269
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,842
She's not back to her old self yet.

270
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:47,842
I think it's shock. 
She won't eat anything.

271
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:49,861
It's a delicate situation.

272
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:51,732
Don't use me as an excuse to skip work.

273
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:53,835
It's a delicate situation here too.

274
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:56,838
- Our prime suspect was arrested by Gohara.
- I know. 
I was there.

275
00:16:56,888 --> 00:16:59,771
Then why didn't you tell us?!

276
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:02,707
Oh yeah.
 I should've done, shouldn't I?

277
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:05,847
Otonashi says she was there when Gohara
arrested Dai-san.

278
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,912
Otonashi?
 Let me.

279
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:11,982
Otonashi. 
Get over here now. 
I want a complete rep-

280
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,971
She cut me off.
She cut me off again!

281
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:21,846
Maybe we can work this out if we met
the previous owner of the diamond.

282
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:24,862
We have to go back soon. 
I have work, too.

283
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,984
But this is also part of the investigation.

284
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:32,034
You say investigation, but 
it's really about the urban legend.

285
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,822
Blue diamond?

286
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:38,843
Mazusawa-san, the one you gave to Kukuko-san.

287
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,829
Where did you get it from?

288
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:44,916
Well, that's going back a bit...

289
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,986
I'm almost there, Katsuura.

290
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,823
Is there anything you want to say?

291
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,825
No...

292
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:56,864
When you had the diamond, did anything strange happen?

293
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,846
No.

294
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,853
Maybe the eye patch has something to do with it?

295
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,836
Oh, this is just an infection

296
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,874
Did something happen to the owner before you?

297
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,856
Nothing.

298
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:10,791
Give me a break.

299
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:15,964
Of course, it's hard for Fukuko-san to talk
so soon after a death in the family.

300
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,800
She was a hard woman.

301
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,720
Especially towards the eldest.

302
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,810
Stupid boy!
 How many times are you going to do this?!

303
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,863
That's why I'm not leaving any part of the company to you.

304
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:32,830
But do you think Dai-san could've killed his mother?

305
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,833
No, I'm sure he didn't.

306
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,919
Why do you say that?

307
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:40,989
I'm telling you it wasn't me.

308
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,927
So you say

309
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:50,997
But I've met some liars in my time, but
you're the worst yet.

310
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:55,820
- Excuse me.
- Why are you guys here?

311
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,805
I just heard from Otonashi.

312
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,792
She's found a witness that can place Dai-san in Ginza

313
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:05,746
It seems that your uncle found you
drunk in the streets.

314
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:08,853
When that boy gets drunk, he gets into
a terrible state.

315
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,838
And I'd recognise that voice anywhere.

316
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,857
Really?
 I left the club in Roppongi

317
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:16,891
And ended up in Ginza?
 Ha ha. 
I don't remember that at all.

318
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:20,865
Someone working in a nearby shop has confirmed
the witness statement.

319
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:24,916
That's a relief. 
Looks like it's all cleared up.

320
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:29,986
Yep, that's how it seems.

321
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:33,976
And what are you doing?

322
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:59,984
Sei-san.
 It's Tannai from the investigation team.

323
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,821
Could I have a quick chat?

324
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,860
Sei-san?
 We're about to open the door.

325
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,896
The door is always locked except when he takes food.

326
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,828
Never opens the door?

327
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,830
Sei-san!
 I'm coming in.

328
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,849
- Please don't.
- Huh? Why?

329
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,921
The door is always locked except
when he takes food.

330
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:19,096
Then why did you bring me up here?

331
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,113
What was Masuzawa hiding from us?

332
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,483
It must be a secret about the diamond.

333
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:31,003
Ah.

334
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:04,769
Now I get it.

335
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,771
Otonashi.

336
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:09,808
Ah, sorry about this morning.

337
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:13,728
Don't worry about it.
I suppose I should thank you.

338
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,749
You should've seen the look on Gohara's face.

339
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,839
The crime isn't solved yet, but I
should treat you to a drink, at least.

340
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:23,764
We still haven't held a welcome party for you.

341
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,841
I guess a late drink is better than none.

342
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,911
- You're not invited, though.
- Huh?

343
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,686
Wait.
 I remember this doll.
 It's hair has grown.

344
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:37,752
- It was shorter last time.
- Really?

345
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:40,755
See? 
It's different to the one next to it.

346
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,757
Huh?

347
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:45,744
I believe you, Katsuura.

348
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:47,762
- Agh!
- Whaat?

349
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:51,833
It's not just that one.

350
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:54,903
There's a doll missing.

351
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:57,874
Huh?

352
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
Katsuura, you know...

353
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:14,839
I think we should talk.

354
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,909
- At home.
- Yeah.

355
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:21,763
Ah, it's Otonashi.

356
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,715
What does she say?

357
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:28,770
"Today it my mother's birthday
so I cannot make it this evening."

358
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,655
That bastard.

359
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:36,744
When I was the new guy on the team if
the boss invited me out, I'd stay out til the end.

360
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,731
I suppose this is old-fashioned too?

361
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:41,733
- No it isn't.
- Jeez.

362
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:44,789
But by amazing coincidence, it's my birthday too.

363
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,771
Huh?

364
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,844
So let's turn this welcome party into a birthday party.

365
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,894
Why?

366
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:59,868
So, there was a doll that'd been taken from
 the room, right?

367
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:03,938
Yes. I remember everything about how they were arranged.

368
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,747
What sort of doll was the one that was missing?

369
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:10,762
Eh? Well, I suppose it had a face...

370
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:12,881
You don't remember?

371
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:15,889
It had a dark cloth over it, so I couldn't see.

372
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,741
A doll whose face you couldn't see...

373
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:28,816
Tsukiko, putting the investigation to one
side for a minute...

374
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:32,767
Ah, it's you again. 
Hello.

375
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,803
You're here again. 
Don't mind me.

376
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,657
Missing doll...
Covered face...

377
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:43,745
What does this have to do with the diamond?

378
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:45,730
Hmm.

379
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,717
Katsuura-san, do you believe in urban myths?

380
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:52,754
Well, if Tsukiko-san says so...

381
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:56,741
The urban myth isn't merely a hoax...

382
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,781
it concerns something that can't be spoken about out loud.

383
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:02,864
Something in the past.

384
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:05,934
That's what Haruki thinks.

385
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,853
Ah, Haruki again.

386
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:12,923
My job is to decipher these hidden messages.

387
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:17,762
This Haruki. 
What kind of man is he?

388
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:21,786
He knows everything about every urban myth
and legend in the world.

389
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,769
I've never met him, or seen a photo.

390
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,754
Not even a photo.

391
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:29,908
A doll without a face.

392
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:31,978
Where did it go?

393
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:39,866
Sei-san. 
Could you pass your tray out?

394
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:51,913
Can I come in... please?

395
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:58,756
"Horror Theatre Unbalance"!
 "Kolchak the night stalker"!

396
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,838
"Mu"!

397
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:02,908
You like this sort of thing?

398
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:06,811
Let me show you something special.

399
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,881
What's that?

400
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,721
Stones from the power spots of the world.
I got it from the internet.

401
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:15,770
Amazing!

402
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,791
- But as for the main thing...
- Hm?

403
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:22,760
I can't see any dolls.

404
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,762
Ah, never mind.

405
00:25:24,832 --> 00:25:26,864
Wow... it's white!

406
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,934
Thank you very much.

407
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:34,739
That's the first time my brother's let anyone
else in his room.

408
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:36,791
You're pretty impressive.

409
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,731
He gave me a souvenir. 
Tuna eyeballs in a jar.

410
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,814
It's rich in docosahexaenoic acid

411
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:45,903
- as brain cells and the nervous system -
- What are you trying to do?

412
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:47,835
Here.

413
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:50,254
Can't you tell?

414
00:25:50,324 --> 00:25:55,226
I know you're trying to find the
person who killed my mother.

415
00:25:55,296 --> 00:26:00,164
But I can't stand to see my family
suspected like this.

416
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:03,350
Do you think it might be someone else?

417
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
I believe so.

418
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:10,224
Can I have a quick look at your room?

419
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:12,259
Any time.

420
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:15,379
It's not a problem.

421
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,449
Excuse me.

422
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:32,246
Satomi.

423
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:34,265
Smoking again.

424
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:37,318
Didn't my lady always disapprove?

425
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,270
Sorry.

426
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,255
Honestly...

427
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:44,258
This house

428
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:48,379
is not the doss house where you grew up

429
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:51,449
like vermin.

430
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,221
Even you did things my lady hated.

431
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,256
Like what?

432
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,264
Wasn't she always angry at you?

433
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,244
Don't give me that!

434
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:06,216
Just a little misunderstanding, now come here -

435
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:08,349
Something smells nice!

436
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,419
Are you having clam soup tonight?

437
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:18,259
She's here again, dressed in that way.

438
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:21,278
Are you really a police officer, dear?

439
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:26,006
- If I was a man, I couldn't do my job.
- Eh?

440
00:27:26,057 --> 00:27:31,208
The police are still mostly men and many people
still think that it's not suitable for women.

441
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:37,281
But when men see me in a mini skirt,
well, actually these are shorts, but -

442
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:39,196
So, dressed like this.

443
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,216
Sometimes, it helps the investigation.

444
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,285
Well, actually,

445
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:47,174
I can't stand wearing stuffy, old-fashioned suits.

446
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,239
Strange girl.

447
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,358
It's not so bad to be strange.

448
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:54,428
Investigating murders is pretty strange too.

449
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:59,432
Satomi. 
Throw those cigarettes away.

450
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:09,360
- Thanks.
- Huh?

451
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,430
You stopped the fight we were having.

452
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:18,417
Well... having a female boss can be tricky.

453
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:22,339
I don't really fit in here.

454
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:27,409
I was born into poverty, which is why I
took such servile work.

455
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:31,248
I'm jealous.

456
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:35,269
When I see someone as confident as you.

457
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,354
I'm not self-confident.

458
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,424
I just act that way.

459
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:45,629
Satomi! 
How long are you going to just stand there?!

460
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,315
Excuse me.

461
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:08,385
I have something I want to tell you.

462
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:11,423
Me?

463
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,226
The one who killed my lady...

464
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,430
may have been me.

465
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:43,236
It's despicable.
Recently, my lady

466
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:46,306
had been worrying a lot about Satomi.

467
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:52,145
That's when I taught my lady everything.

468
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:54,180
About?

469
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,250
About the legend of the facing mirrors.

470
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:08,244
Do you mean, these mirrors here?

471
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:12,314
And then the next day, she was dead.

472
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:18,237
Finally, here it is.

473
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:21,307
The day when I prove a legend.

474
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:32,001
Got it!
 Got it!

475
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:35,021
- Group date?
- Yep. 
I thought maybe you...

476
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:37,073
Would like to join us?

477
00:30:37,143 --> 00:30:39,058
Do you have plans tonight?

478
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,111
- Not really.
- That's great!

479
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:44,431
- Right, we meet a 7 at -
- Katsuura!

480
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:47,086
Tonight I need you to help me with
another experiment.

481
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,036
Wait a sec. 
We asked him first.

482
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:52,158
But this is an important part of the investigation.

483
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,333
- Katsuura, follow me.
- Ah, sorry.

484
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,294
What's up with her?

485
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:00,013
Tannai-san, look at this.

486
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:04,170
We requested a communications
log for Sei-san, and came up with this.

487
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,220
It seems he was trying to delete these messages.

488
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:21,150
Okay, looks like we've got a case against him.

489
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,470
- We'll bring him in tomorrow.
- Sir.

490
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:35,064
Everything's the same as it was that night?

491
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:39,134
Yes. 
And this is the kimono she wore.

492
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,148
- Looking good.
- Okay.

493
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:54,218
So, what's the plan?

494
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:07,079
If you wait until the stroke of midnight, and
 look into two mirrors facing each other,
 you can see your own face as if you were dead.

495
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:10,016
- Apparently.
- As if you were dead.

496
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:13,035
Some say that the devil appears.

497
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:17,173
Fukuko-san heard this story from Matsue-san

498
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:19,243
and tried it for herself.

499
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:24,046
Then the next day.

500
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:25,998
I did what you said

501
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:30,186
and I saw something evil.

502
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:33,256
That evening, Fukuko-san was dead.

503
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:43,352
The curse of the diamond and the
legend of the mirrors

504
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:48,487
Perhaps the two myths combined to create
something terrible.

505
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:50,456
And so

506
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:55,527
I'm going to replicate the circumstances
of Fukuko-san's death

507
00:32:55,597 --> 00:33:00,397
and hopefully I'll see what she saw.

508
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:03,103
What she saw?

509
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,927
Ah, it's out of place again.

510
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:13,946
- What is.
- This mirror. 
It's not lined up.

511
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:15,948
- I put it right before.

512
00:33:16,018 --> 00:33:18,070
I can't stand this kind of thing, so -

513
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
- You moved it?
- Yes.

514
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:26,959
I wonder what made it go back the way it was.

515
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:28,945
Someone who - ah!

516
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:30,967
It must be someone who hates me.
 I'll put it back.

517
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,949
- Wait!!
- Huh?

518
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,972
We have to do this under the same conditions as before.

519
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:39,021
- Lights out.
- Hmmm...

520
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:41,091
Hey! I can't see!

521
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:59,541
Please sit.

522
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:01,611
Okay.

523
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,419
In the space between two mirrors

524
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:15,507
they say you can find the path to enlightenment.

525
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:17,596
Hmm. What?

526
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:30,607
Huh?

527
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,426
Sitting between two facing mirrors

528
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:37,466
I'm reflected in one and also in the one behind me.

529
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:39,448
So as long as I'm here

530
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:42,418
in theory

531
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:47,389
you can see an infinite number of me.

532
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:50,442
Look closely

533
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:56,415
As I move, can you see any differences
in what my reflection does?

534
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:59,435
- I don't think so...
- Really?

535
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:02,521
Look closer.

536
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,591
Wait...

537
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:11,615
Woah!!

538
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:16,552
Did I break it?

539
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:21,622
It's almost midnight. 
What will we see?

540
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:27,546
My cold, dead face.
 Or the devil.

541
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,616
Katsuura, which do you want to see?

542
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:37,389
It'll be midnight in...

543
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:41,477
- another... five seconds.
- Nothing's going to happen.

544
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:43,445
- Four.
- Stay calm.

545
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:46,348
- Three.
- Nothing will happen.

546
00:35:46,418 --> 00:35:48,434
- Two.
- Everything's fine.

547
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:51,437
- One.

548
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:53,455
Woah!!!

549
00:35:53,525 --> 00:36:03,382
(the clock strikes twelve)

550
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:08,554
You see? 
Nothing bad happened.

551
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,624
Huh?

552
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:20,117
Is this

553
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:28,106
The urban legend? It is!

554
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:31,095
Huh?

555
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,154
- Ah!
- Huh?

556
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:50,422
The police officer is here to see you.

557
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:54,917
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

558
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:58,974
Sei-san, once you finish your meal,
could you come with us to the station?

559
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:00,956
My brother? 
Why?

560
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,926
We read your posts on the internet.

561
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:06,946
About how you wanted your mother to die.

562
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,948
Those were just words.

563
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:13,002
You can explain in detail down at the station.

564
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,054
Good morning!

565
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:18,124
- Where did you come from?!
- Ah, Tannai-san.

566
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:22,028
The cursed diamond and the mirrors at midnight.

567
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:26,098
When I put the two together then
I was able to solve the case!

568
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:33,106
So, if I may explain...

569
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:39,949
Look in two facing mirrors at midnight and 
they say you'll see yourself as a corpse or
 the face of the devil.

570
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,981
The late Fukuko-san

571
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,935
tried this one evening and then was
killed the next day.

572
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:48,938
So I tried it myself.

573
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:52,958
Right on midnight, I was able to see something

574
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:58,884
The thing is, when forensics first came here
they saw that this mirror was slightly out of line.

575
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:02,985
So they put it back.
But, last night we found

576
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,955
the mirror had been moved out of line again.

577
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:08,978
Someone had deliberately changed the
angle of the mirror

578
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:11,947
- Why would they do that?
- So that someone would be able to see a
particular thing.

579
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:15,985
Otonashi, just get on with it. 
Who, exactly, are you talking about?

580
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:18,851
Matsue-san.

581
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,306
You were the one who told Fukuko-san

582
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:24,056
about the legend of the mirrors.

583
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:28,961
And because of that she died.

584
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:30,930
So, last night,

585
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,016
in the same situation, I saw the same thing.

586
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:37,086
Matsue-san, what does she mean?

587
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:41,124
Sorry.

588
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,161
I'm very sorry, Kou-san.

589
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:48,898
It was a shame

590
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:53,869
when I looked into the mirror,
 there was no devil, nor my own death mask.

591
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:59,909
Just the image of two lovers meeting
in the garden outside.

592
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:01,944
Lovers?

593
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:04,029
- Ah?
- What?!

594
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:09,099
I saw Satomi-san and Kou-san in each others arms

595
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:22,932
Is this true? 
Kou?
 I'm impressed.

596
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:25,971
But he's 35. 
She's at least fifteen years younger.

597
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,953
That's right.

598
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:34,980
They knew people wouldn't accept them, so when
 Kou-san finished his studies at midnight, 
they would meet.

599
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,946
They did this every night.

600
00:39:37,016 --> 00:39:39,949
But Matsue-san

601
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:42,918
found out about the two lovers.

602
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:45,938
When she thought about what they were doing

603
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,007
she became angry.

604
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:52,077
I've been working here for twenty years.

605
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,966
Kou-san is a good son,

606
00:39:57,036 --> 00:40:02,037
but I could not forgive him for this.

607
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:06,107
So you set up the two mirrors so Fukuko-san
would find out.

608
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:12,915
I wanted Fukuko-san to see the true nature
of Satomi-san.

609
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:15,935
Why didn't you say anything until now?

610
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:18,921
Because I was afraid

611
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:20,906
that Kou-san was the killer.

612
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,992
Matsue-san!

613
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:26,062
I think this should answer everything.

614
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:32,885
This diamond is not all that it seems.

615
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:34,970
Why was Fukuko-san

616
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,006
holding onto it when she died?

617
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:41,026
Because this was the key to the whole mystery.

618
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:43,096
Right, Satomi-san?

619
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,882
I noticed you...

620
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:49,051
Huh?

621
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:52,121
When you apologised on the first day.

622
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,092
"Ah!"

623
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:58,043
"Sorry."

624
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:02,113
Was it you that dropped the vase?

625
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,958
Sorry.

626
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:18,785
When Tsukiko-san and Kou-san were talking they were
getting on really well, and this made you jealous.

627
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,038
All because you liked Kou-san.

628
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:30,796
When Fukuko-san found out about the relationship,
she insisted you break up.

629
00:41:32,998 --> 00:41:35,931
This sash tie

630
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:37,900
was only made recently

631
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,969
and it's an artificial diamond.

632
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,954
- Artificial?
- Recently

633
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:44,873
they look the same as natural diamonds,

634
00:41:44,943 --> 00:41:46,909
except when you x-ray them.

635
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:48,961
And the red glow?

636
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:55,938
This diamond contains boron which is usually blue
but when you expose it to ultra-violet light
 it glows red due to impurities in the jewel.

637
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:58,904
Wait a minute. 
How can it be recent?

638
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,840
My mother has had it for years.

639
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,035
Since the diamond was an important good luck charm

640
00:42:05,097 --> 00:42:08,097
she had it hidden away.

641
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:11,016
So where is the real one?

642
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:13,086
I was looking for it just now.

643
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:17,006
After the murder...

644
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,009
this doll went missing from that room.

645
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,392
I just found it in Satomi-san's room.

646
00:42:29,104 --> 00:42:33,104
Satomi-san. 
Could you tell us the truth about what happened?

647
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:40,012
One night.

648
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:43,082
Fukuko-san called me to her room.

649
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,952
He's fifteen years older than you.

650
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,055
Do you need money that much?

651
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,563
What? 
This is nothing to do with money.

652
00:42:53,912 --> 00:42:55,961
You and your ex-husband

653
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,030
are both deep in debt.

654
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,100
You think I don't know?
I'm no fool.

655
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:06,021
Take this.

656
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:09,091
Think of it as a severance fee.

657
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:13,896
But this is your good luck charm.

658
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:18,050
It's a fake.
 I've hidden the real one away.

659
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,120
So take it and pass it off as genuine.

660
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:27,876
It will get a decent price on the market.

661
00:43:28,046 --> 00:43:30,062
Take it.

662
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:33,015
You've caused a lot of trouble.

663
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:38,971
People like you make me sick. 
Trying to steal what isn't yours.

664
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,176
I think a fake diamond will suit you.

665
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:45,226
Now, I'm giving you a second chance,
if you'll just leave.

666
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,249
So, Fukuko-san

667
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,319
died, holding the sash tie.

668
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:16,224
The day after the murder I realised
where the hiding place of the diamond must be.

669
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:18,294
Here it is.

670
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:23,298
So why didn't you sell it and escape?

671
00:44:26,304 --> 00:44:29,304
It wasn't so easy to find a buyer.

672
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,375
You lied to me.

673
00:44:35,263 --> 00:44:38,263
- You killed my mother.
- Stand back.

674
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:42,250
You're the lowest.

675
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,320
This woman is scary.

676
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:48,979
Usue Satomi-san. 
Please accompany us to the station.

677
00:44:51,263 --> 00:44:53,263
Let's go.

678
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:00,102
If you wanted to escape, you could have.

679
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:03,288
But you didn't.

680
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:08,358
Night after night with Kou-san, you began
to grown fond of him.

681
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:15,299
Because I saw you under the cherry blossom trees.

682
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:24,212
You were trying to catch the blossom as it fell
 because they say 
if you catch three, then your love will come true.

683
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:27,212
And you wanted to believe that.

684
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:30,282
Isn't that why you were trying so hard?

685
00:45:35,223 --> 00:45:38,240
But...

686
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,310
I only ever caught two.

687
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Let's go.

688
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,916
Got it. 
Okay.

689
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:22,718
What's that?

690
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:24,753
About the blue diamond.

691
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,740
- It seems it's stolen goods.
- What?!

692
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,775
Mazusawa must have bought it

693
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:33,762
knowing it had been stolen

694
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:38,801
but quickly gave it away when he lost his
eye in an accident.

695
00:46:38,871 --> 00:46:42,755
The original owners of the diamond

696
00:46:42,825 --> 00:46:45,724
all committed suicide.

697
00:46:45,794 --> 00:46:47,693
No way.

698
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,782
Maybe the Hope Diamond is cursed.

699
00:46:49,832 --> 00:46:51,770
That's only what Otonashi says.

700
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:53,732
Don't let her fool you.

701
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:55,818
You're right.

702
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:58,888
- She always kicks up a fuss.
- About that...

703
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:07,863
Saying you were lied to about a cursed
diamond so you committed murder

704
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,933
won't stand up in court.

705
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,697
This is pretty weird. 
And why do I always ended up helping you?

706
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:24,780
Because you're a nice guy and easily led.

707
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,719
Huh?

708
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:06,858
- You're trying again?
- Just once isn't enough.

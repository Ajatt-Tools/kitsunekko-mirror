1
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,833
- Morning.
- Morning.

2
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:02,851
- Good morning.
- What the...?

3
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:04,887
For the next three days, I'll be your bodyguard.

4
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:07,940
- He's going to protect your life.
- That again?

5
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,358
Take care...

6
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:14,296
you'll be dead within a week.

7
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,364
The thing is, since then...

8
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:19,367
Dangerous things keep happening to you.

9
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:21,253
Like on the first day when you fell into that moat.

10
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:24,356
Only because I was trying to see a Kappa.

11
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:28,343
On the second day you were bitten by that dog,
on the third day you had a strange fever,

12
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,364
Yesterday, if it weren't for me, you'd
have been trapped under that steel...

13
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:36,151
It's just that my ability to sense
danger has weakened a bit.

14
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:39,304
It's because of the magic spell, and there's
still three days left.

15
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:44,309
You seem more worried than my sister,
and you're the one getting injured.

16
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:49,347
These are nothing, compared to Tsukiko's life.

17
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,334
Yeah, but you are overdoing it a bit.

18
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,234
Look out!

19
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:54,352
What?!

20
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:55,940
Stay away from the kitchen.

21
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,545
There are sharp objects, like knives and forks.
It's dangerous.
Please sit down.

22
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,233
- It'll be fine, Katsuura.
- No, no.

23
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:10,303
Why are you filming me?

24
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,509
Look out!

25
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,233
Three more days...

26
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:28,236
and you plan to stay with Tsukiko until then?

27
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:31,306
Well, the thing is...
I have work to go to.

28
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:33,241
Of course.

29
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,244
So while I'm at work, may I ask you all
to act as her guards.

30
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,230
Guards?
Us?

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,267
Please pay extra attention to Tsukiko-san.

32
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:45,153
- Of course, we accept.
- Idiot!

33
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:49,241
Each detective has to be able to
look after themselves.

34
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:51,243
(phone)

35
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,161
Huh?

36
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,297
That's odd.
You didn't know it was about to ring?

37
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,465
Indeed.

38
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:00,301
This must be the magic:
she can't sense impending danger.

39
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,537
Hello?

40
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,507
What?

41
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,657
A murder in the park?

42
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:13,032
- These are...?
- It's a little disturbing.

43
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:18,003
Woah... you're right.

44
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:22,224
Tsukiko! and the rest of Tannai's team...

45
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,943
What have you found, Tsukiko?

46
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,763
We found his identity card.

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,815
Shinbori Saburo, 35.

48
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,684
Estimated time of death,
 around six o'clock this morning.

49
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,737
It seems he died from a blow to the back of
the head from this stone.

50
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,841
Okay.
Take him for autopsy!

51
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,911
Sir!

52
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,348
What are these characters?

53
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:49,417
"Tsu, ru, ka"

54
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,487
What do you think that means?

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,234
Kagome, Kagome

56
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:59,280
Bird in a cage

57
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,431
When will you come out?

58
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,431
- Next.
- What? Me?

59
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:08,446
In the evening of the dawn

60
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,006
The crane and the turtle

61
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:11,976
Yes.

62
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:14,025
That's it, everyone.

63
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:18,079
Do you know, legend says that the nursery rhyme
"Kagome Kagome"

64
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,070
actually has a deeper meaning.

65
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,052
Again with these stories?

66
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,054
The words crane and turtle

67
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:30,008
are said to refer to some hidden place.

68
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:32,043
Hidden?
What?

69
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:36,064
The secret gold reserves of the Tokugawa shogunate.

70
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,033
Tsukiko, I hope this'll be short.

71
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:43,038
In 1868,
when the Tokugawa shogunate stepped down, and

72
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:48,026
Meiji government officials entered the castle vaults
they found them empty.

73
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:52,733
It is thought that the gold had been taken away
and buried somewhere in secret.

74
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,083
That's the Tokugawa gold mystery.

75
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:58,036
Oh yeah.
I saw something about that on TV.

76
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:02,057
That's right.
And the words of this song hold a clue to
the treasure.

77
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,092
"Kagome,
Kagome"?

78
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:10,248
The turtle and the crane are part of
the decorations of the Nikkou Toushou Guu shrine

79
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,233
But what's that got to do with this crime?

80
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,283
A lot.

81
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:16,171
Look at the man's dying message.

82
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,239
"Tsu ru ka"

83
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,258
Tsuruka...
Tsuru Kame!
"Crane and Turtle"?

84
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:24,295
Right.
I believe that's what this man was trying to write.

85
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,247
Seriously?

86
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,183
Look at this map.

87
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,236
The Nikkou Toushou Guu shrine is marked

88
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,154
Also Mount Akagi in Gunma prefecture.

89
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:37,325
It is suspected that the treasure is hidden
in one of these two places.

90
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,395
- Really?
- What's more...

91
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:44,199
this road leads to the Toushou Guu in Ueno.

92
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:49,237
Which is also rumoured to hide the buried gold.

93
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,239
Huh? Then...

94
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:56,244
Shinbori-san was looking for...
the Tokugawa hidden treasure.

95
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,231
And that is why he was attacked.

96
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,134
- Shibayama!
- Sir?

97
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,203
- Let's go.
- Sir.

98
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,338
This incident...

99
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,408
may have the future of the hidden gold at stake!

100
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,305
Subs: ersby

101
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:27,319
raws: furransu

102
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,701
We're back.

103
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,953
Tannai-san.

104
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:40,703
- Tsukiko may be onto something.
- In what way?

105
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:45,060
The late Shinbori-san had a hobby of going out
on weekends looking for treasure.

106
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,179
All his co-workers knew this.

107
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,066
He had two friends,
and together they'd go searching.

108
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,051
Just as I thought.

109
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,936
So, what about these other two people?

110
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:58,023
Hmm, it seems they met on the internet.

111
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,041
First, I think I should meet them.

112
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:04,062
Otonashi! 
When doing a murder investigation, family and
 close friends are...

113
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,048
the first people you question, to get right to
 the heart of the crime.

114
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:09,067
- That's the celery!
- You mean "theory"?

115
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,038
Well, Tannai-san, you go ahead.

116
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:18,093
My Gold Reserves Team will track down these two.

117
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,061
- Let's go, Katsuura.
- Excuse us!

118
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,030
It was "theory"...

119
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,033
Is he really going to guard her
for the next three days?

120
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:29,204
Forget them!
Let's start our investigation by questioning those
close to the victim.

121
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:32,274
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

122
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,054
The three engravings!

123
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:50,108
Can this be the rumoured underground
path from Souhyou Temple?

124
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,060
What's that?

125
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,049
There's a code showing the location of the
hidden gold somewhere in these three engravings.

126
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:02,103
Unfortunately the original copper
plate has gone missing.

127
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,939
So these are them?

128
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,027
- Where did you get them?
- These aren't genuine.

129
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:11,980
But you are police officers?

130
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,539
Ah, sorry.

131
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,101
How rude of me.

132
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:19,037
I'm Officer Otonashi.
This is my assistant, Katsuura.

133
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:22,040
Katsuura of the Identification Team.

134
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm Narita.
Please sit down.

135
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,230
Thank you.

136
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:31,049
So, you having something to ask me?

137
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,155
This is a great house.

138
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,071
What do you do for a living?

139
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,023
I worked all my life in I.T.

140
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:43,044
But two years ago I set up my own company.
That's also when I bought this house.

141
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:47,132
- Where did you get the money?
- Tsukiko, isn't that a little abrupt?

142
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:52,036
At first I thought "no way" but
when I saw your house...

143
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:56,040
My suspicions became convictions.

144
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,110
Suspicions?
About what?

145
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,046
Don't play dumb.

146
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:05,984
Narita-san.
You...
found it, didn't you?

147
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:09,070
- What?
- The gold reserves.

148
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,055
Whaat?!

149
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,042
That's how you can afford a house like
this at such a young age.

150
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,111
No, that's a little...

151
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,181
These engravings are the real thing, aren't they?

152
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,998
Where did you find the gold?

153
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:25,153
I haven't found anything.

154
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:26,901
What form was it in?

155
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,273
Gold coins?
Bullion?

156
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,044
If you're not here about Shinbori-san, then
please excuse me.

157
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,013
- I have work to do.
- Aaaah.

158
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,065
The proper questioning starts now.

159
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,050
What was your relationship to Shinbori-san?

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,986
I met him about ten years ago on the internet.

161
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:45,039
Sometimes at the weekend, we'd go searching
for lost treasure.

162
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:47,041
That's about it.

163
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,010
At least give me a clue!

164
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,131
Is "turtle and crane" really a clue to the location?

165
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,201
I'm sick of your questions.

166
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,002
Well, he didn't seem pleased.

167
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:01,039
- Perhaps because he's guilty.
- I guess.

168
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:06,264
People still say the location of the treasure is
unknown, and I believe them.

169
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,997
So obviously, he can't have found it.

170
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,132
But, about the murder...

171
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:16,202
Haruki says so too, so it must be true.

172
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,208
Okay! Let's go and see the other person.

173
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,030
- What did you just buy?
- What?

174
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,034
Are you Mejiro Etsuko-san?
I'm Officer Otonashi.

175
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:34,038
- Is this about Shinbori-san?
- Is that a present for someone?

176
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:37,041
Or did you buy it for yourself?
Did you get a bonus or something?

177
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,113
I can buy what I want for whoever I want.

178
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:42,150
Oh, of course.
But, you see... I know...

179
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,115
Eh?

180
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,105
That's you found the gold reserves.

181
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,352
I went to see Narita-san.

182
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,023
I even saw the three engravings.

183
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,013
Oh that.
He bought that near Mount Akagi.

184
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:59,030
So the treasure is around there after all?

185
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,982
No, those engravings are fake.

186
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:05,086
From the start, I thought that such an
engraving couldn't be true.

187
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:08,056
There's no reason for any encryption.

188
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:13,044
Why wouldn't it be split up and buried at
every temple?

189
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:17,135
I see.
So it's at the Toushou Guu in Ueno.

190
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,052
Ah, this is my assistant, Katsuura.

191
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:24,038
Katsuura,
did you find out what Etsuko-san just bought?

192
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:28,993
I'm Katsuura, her bodyguard. 
It was something for a man, costing about
 three million yen.

193
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,080
I knew it!
You found the gold reserves!

194
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,826
Don't be stupid!

195
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,034
I used my savings.

196
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:39,037
You met Shinbori-san on the net.

197
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:43,074
Yes.
At first we wrote to each other on bulletin boards.

198
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,044
Later,

199
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,075
the three of us would meet to go treasure hunting.

200
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:50,031
But I haven't been going that often recently.

201
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:54,102
- Because you'd found what you were looking for?
- No way!

202
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:58,139
- There's probably no such thing as the
gold reserves. 
- Stop misdirecting.

203
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,786
Can I go now?

204
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,259
My break is over.

205
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,980
It's a bit strange.

206
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,151
They said she'd also bought something
expensive last week, too.

207
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:13,221
You see?
I knew it!

208
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,113
Hey, Tsukiko-san!
It's dangerous to run like that!

209
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,107
Tsukiko-san!
Look out!

210
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:47,338
Assistant Commissioner!

211
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,494
You don't miss a thing, as usual, Tsukiko.

212
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,329
You!

213
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,348
We meet again!

214
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,350
You two know each other?

215
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,369
Well, you could say that.

216
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,387
What do you mean by that?

217
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:06,390
Please, tell us your name!

218
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,460
- Tsukiko-
- Wait wait wait...

219
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:15,349
My name is Oguri.
Oguri Ryutaro.

220
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,286
Oguri?
Where've I heard that before?

221
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:22,323
You were seen in the vicinity of three
murders of fortune tellers.

222
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:24,375
What were you doing?

223
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:27,345
Well, you see...
I like to go for walks around the city.

224
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,330
Is that all?

225
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,350
But that case is already closed-

226
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,882
I've got it!

227
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,503
Oguri...

228
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:39,573
Are you related to
Oguri Kozukenosuke Tadamasa?

229
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,343
Oguri who?

230
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,278
You see...

231
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,313
- Oh wait!
- We're a little busy.

232
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,400
- But, Takeshi!
- Otonashi!

233
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,470
Just leave it be.

234
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:59,443
This is all connected, Katsuura.

235
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,513
Huh?

236
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:09,060
- According to a colleague, the late Shinbori-san
 had become more generous recently.
- In what way?

237
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:13,340
Before, he was the type to
divide the bill for drinks exactly, but recently
he's been buying drinks for everyone.

238
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,328
- And his suits are tailor-made.
- Where did he get this money?

239
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,330
We still don't know.

240
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,366
His bank account only has records of his
salary payments.

241
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,860
What's this?

242
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,353
See?
I told you so.

243
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:28,339
"Hey hey hey" she says,

244
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,342
but have you come up with anything new?

245
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,477
You might not like it, but...

246
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:36,547
do you remember this man?

247
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,287
The person we thought killed those fortune tellers?

248
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:46,340
This man is called Oguri-san.

249
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,359
So?

250
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,296
At the end of the Edo period,
Oguri Tadamasa served as a magistrate.

251
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:55,349
They say he's the one who hid the gold.

252
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:58,352
Oguri...
Oguri Kozukenosuke Tadamasa?

253
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:00,321
You've heard of him, Tannai-san?

254
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:03,324
Shibayama,
you were in your university's mountaineering club.

255
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:06,327
When I was at school,
I was part of a historical research club.

256
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:08,279
Then I shall keep this brief.

257
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:12,299
Oguri Tadamasa hid the gold reserves

258
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,353
to help restore the Shogunate, so it is said.

259
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:19,323
And the servants who helped were executed.

260
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:22,343
There's a theory this was an order from above

261
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:25,346
This way, there were no descendants.

262
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,348
It can't be...

263
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:31,402
If you think about it, it was a strange thing for
Chihiro-san to say.

264
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,339
"You don't need money once you know
where to get it."

265
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:39,310
Maybe, thanks to her mysterious powers

266
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,378
she knew about the hidden gold.

267
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:47,351
So if this person is Oguri's descendant,
he must protect the treasure.

268
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:50,354
I have researched into it...

269
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:55,342
and I think Oguri-san, even now,
is responsible for guarding the secret location.

270
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,294
Is this stupid story all that you've got?

271
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,331
But, this person is no ordinary man.

272
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:02,349
He was in the Assistant Commissioner's car.

273
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,368
The Assistant Commissioner?

274
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:06,303
Also, he spoke to the Assistant
Commissioner informally.

275
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:12,343
Now I think about it, when we first met at
Masakado's shrine, that was no accidental meeting.

276
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:16,463
That shrine was particularly
important to Tokugawa Ieyasu

277
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,533
and so he's still maintaining that shrine.

278
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:26,340
The mountain at Takao had also been heavily
protected by Tokugawa.

279
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,344
This man is patrolling the important places
of the Tokugawa legacy.

280
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:34,184
The same places that they were looking for
the treasure.

281
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,299
They?

282
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,319
The deceased Shinbori-san,

283
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:42,339
Narita-san and Mejiro-san.

284
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:45,242
Mejiro-san was buying expensive jewellery.

285
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,294
Narita-san's house was amazing.

286
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,330
Is all this true?

287
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,333
Yes.
Because of this, the group split up.

288
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:54,251
But perhaps...

289
00:16:54,321 --> 00:17:00,324
They took some of the gold without permission they
awoke the 300-year old curse of the Tokugawas.

290
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,393
You think this is a curse?

291
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,245
In any case...

292
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,298
They just happened to find the gold reserves

293
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,333
which brought them bad luck.

294
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,336
Could everyone start investigating that
possibility?

295
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,371
And what will you do?

296
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,341
I'm going to prove that the gold reserves existed.

297
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,343
That's my mission.

298
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:25,382
But the Shogunate was in financial
difficulties, so they'd have no gold to bury!

299
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:29,353
Wow, there really are people with
no imagination like you.

300
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,340
That's why if I find the gold reserves

301
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,342
it'll be all over the news.

302
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:38,312
- And you think you can find it?
- Yun!

303
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:42,349
With such amazing news, it'll make everyone happy!

304
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,368
And so...!

305
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,403
I'll begin.

306
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,355
Tsukiko-san!
It's too dangerous to go alone!

307
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,341
- Goodbye!
- What should we do?

308
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:53,427
There's no way that gold exists!

309
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:54,328
Fine.

310
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,547
Let's find out where Shinbori's money came from.

311
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,502
Tannai-san?

312
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:04,338
Another two days, and there's danger everywhere.

313
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:07,341
Every morning, it's
"Danger danger danger."
Give it a rest.

314
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,326
Ah, Katsuura?

315
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:11,328
Where are you two going so early?

316
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:13,430
Ah, good morning - aah!

317
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Look out!

318
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,334
Katsuura!

319
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,370
You're definitely a jinx.

320
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,355
Are you okay?

321
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:41,292
Katsuura, I think it'd be okay for me to go alone.

322
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:43,310
Huh?

323
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm going on an investigation.
I'll leave him in your hands.

324
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,550
Tsukiko-san!
Tsukiko-san!

325
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:57,589
I keep telling you, we never found any gold.

326
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,675
I understand.
You don't want everyone to know.

327
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:04,662
But, for the urban myth community, the
Tokugawa gold is

328
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:06,614
like a romantic dream.

329
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:10,685
For that reason, please tell me you found it!

330
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,670
You're funny.

331
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,972
Huh?

332
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:19,043
It must be nice having an interesting job.

333
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:23,363
It is.
It's fun.

334
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:26,150
Such a good working environment.

335
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,153
No, no.
You should meet my boss.

336
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:31,205
You can't call that a good working environment.

337
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,241
But you like your job, right?

338
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:36,127
This is what I want to do, but sometimes

339
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:39,347
I feel like I don't know what I'm doing.

340
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:44,151
"What you want to do"...

341
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,154
I wish there was something I wanted to do.

342
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,290
Huh?

343
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Somehow, everything seems like a chore.

344
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:57,234
Etsuko-san. 
Why do you say that?

345
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,519
Mejiro-san. 
A moment, please.

346
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,954
Excuse me.

347
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:05,122
What?

348
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,142
Some police officers are here to see you.

349
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:12,129
Er... apart from her?

350
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:16,083
Yes.
They said they had some important questions.
They're in the board room.

351
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:19,220
I see.
Sorry about this.
I won't be a minute.

352
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,290
Of course.

353
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,882
The "Kagome,

354
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,337
the turtle and

355
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:30,297
the crane" thing
was fun for a while.

356
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:34,242
Huh?

357
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:37,204
Was that a clue?

358
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:40,274
Kagome, crane and turtle...?

359
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,251
Kagome, crane and turtle...?

360
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,120
- Damn.
Call for back-up immediately.
- Sir!

361
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,140
- Gohara-san, what's wrong?
- That woman escaped.

362
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,159
- That woman...?
- Otonashi!

363
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:00,144
Watch it!

364
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:02,146
What the hell are you doing in a place like this?

365
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:04,165
I guess you're here for the same reasons?

366
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:07,118
We found the source of Shinbori-san's wealth.

367
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,170
You know it too?

368
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,188
What are you talking about?

369
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:13,224
Mejiro Etsuko had been embezzling money from here.

370
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:16,294
She'd been seeing a host at a bar.

371
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:21,148
So, that was for the host.

372
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,250
Shinbori-san found out

373
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,320
and she'd been paying him to keep quiet.

374
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,309
So after he started blackmailing
her, she killed him.

375
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:36,163
We think.

376
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,166
So, where is Mejiro Etsuko-san?

377
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,135
- She ran away.
- Ran away?!

378
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:44,055
I've already called for back-up so
she won't get far.

379
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,140
- Shibayama, let's go.
- Sir!

380
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,159
This way.

381
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:51,232
Otonashi, you too.

382
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:55,132
Bring Tsukiko-san back immediately.

383
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:59,153
Look, we've got a suspect on the run.

384
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,172
But look at me!

385
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:04,125
If I hadn't been in the way, all of this
would've happened to her.

386
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:09,163
Certainly, this week Tsukiko-san's
seemed a little strange.

387
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:13,100
Katsuura, look after yourself too.

388
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,152
What are you doing here?

389
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:19,173
I'm here to give you this, Katsuura.

390
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:21,142
What is it?

391
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:25,162
A list of all the theories about
the hidden gold throughout history.

392
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:29,116
And on internet forums, I found

393
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:31,135
many more cases.

394
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,154
You mean...

395
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:36,207
These are people who accessed a
bulletin board about the gold?

396
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:38,242
- Hm.
- But there are thousands.

397
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:43,130
Yes, but mostly, plans made on internet
forums never go any where.

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,134
Recently there have been fewer people
chasing their dreams.

399
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:50,121
Do you mean, that you keep this kind of record

400
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:53,240
As part of your job protecting the Tokugawa gold?

401
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,310
There it is!

402
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,114
We policemen do not believe in things
like hidden treasures.

403
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:04,151
It's your right to believe or not.

404
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:10,157
That is what makes it an urban legend!

405
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:12,243
Tannai-san?

406
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:14,313
Tannai-san!
Tannai-san?!

407
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:20,134
"In the evening of the dawn,"

408
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:24,205
"the crane and turtle slipped"

409
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:26,157
You seem happy, Katsuura.

410
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:30,161
Even since Etsuko-san escaped, things
have got worse.

411
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:32,146
Because you safely got through another day.

412
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:36,317
"Who is the face behind you?"

413
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:39,387
Eh? "the face behind you?"

414
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:43,307
Wait.
Could it be...

415
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:48,145
- I've got it, Katsuura.
- Huh?

416
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:51,115
The crane is a bird that flies south.

417
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:54,201
And I've heard that turtles can be used
to mean "to the north".

418
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:56,053
So, look at this.

419
00:23:56,123 --> 00:24:00,090
Nikko Toushou Guu and the Imperial Palace
are linked by a north-south line.

420
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,262
If you stand here and look towards the palace

421
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:07,332
The palace is behind...

422
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,152
Sakuradamon.

423
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:14,104
Eh? The police headquarters?

424
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:17,157
Can you think of a safer hiding place?

425
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:21,145
So that explains why Oguri-san knows
the Assistant Commissioner.

426
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:24,131
That reminds me, he came to our office.

427
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,267
Eh? The investigation office?

428
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,337
He gave me this.

429
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:33,224
A list of people who've used internet forums
about the Tokugawa gold.

430
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,294
Hmmm.

431
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,114
Haruki's here.

432
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:43,150
Haruki0603.
That's the name he uses online.

433
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,289
His birthday's on June the third.

434
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:51,258
So, Haruki also researched into the hidden gold.

435
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,328
That makes me want to try harder!

436
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:59,284
Wait.
This name?

437
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:05,089
Where have I seen it before?

438
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,225
- Katsuura, could you give me a massage?
- What?!

439
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:13,295
I've been running around trying to find
Etsuko-san, and now my legs are all stiff.

440
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:18,172
Are... are you sure that's okay?

441
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:30,249
Well...

442
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Here I go...

443
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:50,150
I'm back.

444
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,203
Yep, there you are.
Bang on time.
As usual.

445
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:55,239
Have I done something wrong?

446
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:59,093
It's okay, Katsuura.
I'll get a massage from Miyako.

447
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:02,229
Then, I'll head back.
Go back home.

448
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,299
Sorry for being a bother.

449
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:07,386
Thanks for having me.

450
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,707
I see.
You want to search this building?

451
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:28,793
The gold reserves should be somewhere
in the basement.

452
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:30,678
That's absurd!

453
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:33,698
If you've got that much free time,
you should be looking for Mejiro-san.

454
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:35,784
Nope.
No way.

455
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:38,736
Today, Tsukiko-san mustn't set foot outside.

456
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,805
- Huh?
- It's the last day.

457
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:45,777
- So far today, nothing dangerous has happened, but
 what if something did?
- Otonashi will be fine!

458
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:48,730
It's the last day I want to hear about this power!

459
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,748
Now get back to work!

460
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,750
- Please keep a close eye on her.
- Okay, I get it.

461
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,837
- Even when she goes to the toilet.
- Eh?!

462
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,907
Could I have a moment?

463
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:05,079
- I can't take this any more.
- Huh?

464
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:07,031
You know the power of words?

465
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:10,101
If you keep saying something negative
it'll come true.

466
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:14,055
You keep talking about danger, and
before long, something will happen.

467
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,074
So, you're saying I'm the cause of these things?

468
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:20,161
That's right.
Solving the mystery of the gold reserves is
just one step away.

469
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,231
Stop bothering me.

470
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:26,033
I see... I understand.

471
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,137
I'll stop worrying so much.

472
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:32,207
I don't know what'll happen.

473
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:42,232
Katsuura!
Katsuura!

474
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,069
What a terrible person.

475
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:47,071
We just heard everything.

476
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:49,073
Katsuura, to think you went to all that trouble.

477
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:51,075
And what did she do?

478
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:52,994
"Crane and the turtle slipped"

479
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:56,164
she just sang to herself.

480
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,234
Turtle...

481
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,152
- Turtle?
- Turtle?

482
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,222
- Turtle!
- Turtle?

483
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:06,274
That's it!

484
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:11,913
The Tokugawa gold is hidden at
Sakuradamon. Definitely.

485
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,882
But, I would have heard of that...

486
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:17,885
But since it is at the Police Headquarters

487
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:20,888
To hide it secretly would be impossible.

488
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,891
Unless they had some help from inside the police.

489
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:27,862
That's why someone would talk.
I don't think the gold is hidden there.

490
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:31,983
If we found such a thing,
none of us would say anything.

491
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:34,053
Not even her.

492
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:40,892
Etsuko-san wouldn't have had reason to embezzle.

493
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:44,912
Certainly,
people who've found treasure have blackmailed others.

494
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:46,881
Although it seems odd.

495
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:50,902
But she must've known something.

496
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:53,855
Before she escaped she said something to me.

497
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:59,844
The "Kagome,
the turtle and
the crane" thing was fun for a while.

498
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:01,879
Really it was.

499
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:06,918
I think she was giving me a clue
to the location of the gold.

500
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:08,870
No, I doubt that.

501
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,823
It matches the dying message from
Shinbori-san, too.

502
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,975
Dying message?

503
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:19,045
Shinbori-san wrote "Tsuruka" on the ground
before he died.

504
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:27,004
What do you think he meant?

505
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,858
You can't run away any more, Narita-san.

506
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:33,961
This is definitely a hint to the location

507
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,031
of the gold, isn't it?

508
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:39,867
Is it okay if I just finish an errand?

509
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:42,870
Then I can tell you all about the gold.

510
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,939
Finally, I get to hear the true story!

511
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,009
Yeah... sure.

512
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:56,984
This is it!

513
00:29:57,054 --> 00:30:00,054
The legend of the gold
reserves... solved!

514
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:21,043
I knew it.

515
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,868
Ah, excuse me.

516
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:33,871
I'm waiting to see President Narito.

517
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:35,857
The president has gone out.

518
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:38,926
- Where did he go?
- I'm sure I don't know.

519
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm sure you'd remember if you thought about it.

520
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,951
Ah, this is a nice colour.

521
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:49,021
Your tie's crooked.

522
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:52,843
Katsuura?

523
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,843
What are you doing down here?

524
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:57,895
Akiyama-san...
don't scare me like that.

525
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:59,964
Katsuura!

526
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:01,954
Your collar!
Bent again.

527
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:04,084
I can fix it myself.

528
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,921
Got it.
This is...!

529
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,504
Narita-san!

530
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:10,941
Are you in?

531
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:13,948
Narita-san!

532
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,870
What is it, Katsuura?

533
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,856
"Tsukiko-san, I worked it out."

534
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,891
"The meaning of the message Shinbori-san
left behind".

535
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:30,878
That's a clue to the place where
the gold reserves are hidden.

536
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:33,881
"Wrong. They refer to names.
Of people.

537
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,950
Huh?

538
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,020
"Tsuru" was the name of a person.

539
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,042
Of course!

540
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,866
"Tsukiko-san?
Tsukiko-san?"

541
00:31:51,936 --> 00:31:53,885
"Tsukiko-san!"

542
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,904
Tsukiko-san, where are you now?

543
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:58,943
I'm at Narita-san's house.

544
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,844
She hung up.

545
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:05,897
She hung up on me!
What do I do now?

546
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,102
My battery ran out!

547
00:32:21,882 --> 00:32:24,932
This woman was working in a credit
union around here.

548
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:26,901
Do you know her?

549
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:29,987
Oh, it's mine.

550
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:33,057
- I've seen her a few times,
- Where?

551
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:35,877
Hello.

552
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:38,880
Ah, Gohara-san.
What it is?

553
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,884
We've apprehended Mejiro Etsuko-san.

554
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:45,870
I true I was being blackmailed by Shinbori-san.

555
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,875
To keep him quiet about the money.
But I never killed him.

556
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:53,978
But keep searching for Shinbori-san's killer.

557
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:56,048
Thanks for your hard work.

558
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:01,836
- Tannai-san.
- Shibayama, we were beaten to it again.

559
00:33:01,906 --> 00:33:03,971
Was that Gohara-san?

560
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,041
Who is it now?

561
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:07,892
Hello?

562
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:10,861
This is bad.
It's Tsukiko-san.

563
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,813
You again?
What's up?

564
00:33:12,883 --> 00:33:14,882
"I think Tsukiko-san may have been killed."

565
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,054
What did you say?

566
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,062
Narita-san?

567
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:47,051
Narita-san?

568
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:52,955
You're starting to get on my nerves.

569
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:58,926
The last words that Shinbori-san wanted to write...

570
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,996
were "Crane is the killer".

571
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:07,051
The crane being you.

572
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:11,806
On a map in his possessions...

573
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:16,911
we found a map with "Turtle 1977" written on it.

574
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,948
That was the name Shinbori-san used
on an internet forum.

575
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:26,018
The forum had been deleted, but
we were able to restore it.

576
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,889
When you met on the internet...

577
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,842
You'd used names taken from the nursery rhyme.

578
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:33,129
"Kagome",

579
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,144
"Crane", and

580
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:36,781
"Turtle".

581
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:42,820
Shinbori-san was the turtle.
Etsuko-san was Kagome.

582
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,940
And so, Narita-san...

583
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,010
You were the crane.

584
00:34:57,037 --> 00:34:59,037
So you got that far...

585
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,853
Tsukiko?

586
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:16,911
No idea.

587
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:19,874
There's no one inside.

588
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:23,944
Maybe, Tsukiko is already...?

589
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:26,881
If I hadn't made her angry, we'd have
been together...

590
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:30,885
- Snap out of it!
- But today's the last day...

591
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:34,772
I don't believe in prophecy or fortune telling.

592
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,825
I only trust my intuition.

593
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:41,879
Even if it has gotten a bit slow recently.

594
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:46,304
- But when it comes down to it, it's always right.
- Tannai-san.

595
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,603
My intuition tells me that...

596
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:53,974
Otonashi is still alive somewhere.

597
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:58,044
What's more, she's somewhere near here.

598
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,866
We'll search the area and get her back!

599
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:03,818
- Okay, let's go!
- Sir!

600
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:05,956
- Let's try this way.
- Okay.

601
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,952
Why can't I focus on the case?

602
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:41,056
This belongs to Tsukiko-san.

603
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:56,887
What are you going to do?

604
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:59,890
Escape.
Somewhere abroad.

605
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,876
But your company?

606
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:04,879
This weekend they'll discover it's
10 million yen in debt

607
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:08,983
- And about to go bankrupt.
- Huh?

608
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:13,053
So you can see why I needed the money.

609
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:16,991
So, you couldn't wait any more...

610
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:22,880
I didn't know about Etsuko-san stealing
from her company.

611
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,917
Nor did I know about Shinbori-san blackmailing her.

612
00:37:26,987 --> 00:37:29,987
So...

613
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:36,041
So you came to the same conclusion as me.

614
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:44,919
Shinbori-san must have found the gold reserves.

615
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:47,872
What?
You think I have the gold?

616
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:50,875
How else could you become so rich recently?

617
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:51,945
No way.

618
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:53,811
That's not it.

619
00:37:53,931 --> 00:37:56,931
I need the money.
10 million by the end of the week.

620
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:00,070
So where is the gold?

621
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:02,887
Is it near here?

622
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,855
Why else would you be out

623
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:06,874
so early in the morning?

624
00:38:06,944 --> 00:38:08,926
It's my day off

625
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,778
I thought I could make more
progress searching alone.

626
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,897
Is it in here?

627
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:14,882
Do you have a map to the treasure here?

628
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,901
- What are you doing?
- Even a clue...?

629
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:19,920
Anything at all!
Don't keep it to yourself!

630
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,925
Get off me!

631
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:38,923
But inside Shinbori-san's rucksack

632
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:40,993
you couldn't find any new clues.

633
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:49,850
Three people started out on a treasure hunt

634
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,903
but eventually

635
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:57,973
there was nothing romantic about the way it ended.

636
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:02,880
I can still escape!

637
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,865
I have a basement that no one knows.

638
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,985
Once I kill you, I can hide your body.

639
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,971
But I still haven't been able to prove one yet!

640
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,041
What?

641
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:19,863
I have to prove that at least one urban
myth has caused a crime.

642
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:24,868
When I thought the gold had been found,
I thought I'd finally done it.

643
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:28,889
It's a shame.

644
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,925
I researched all sorts of myths, too.

645
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,995
But one by one, each turned out to be just stories.

646
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:40,834
No...

647
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:46,056
you just didn't try hard enough.

648
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:50,126
To find the unexplained.

649
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,851
Tsukiko-san!

650
00:39:57,921 --> 00:39:59,957
Katsuura!

651
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:11,649
Katsuura!

652
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,883
Katsuura!

653
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:56,742
Tsukiko-san!

654
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:58,798
Katsuura!

655
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,871
Huh?

656
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
Katsuura, look out!

657
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,851
Otonashi!

658
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:24,821
Are you okay?

659
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:27,891
Narita!
Give up!

660
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:32,695
There was a fingerprint on the
stone used as a weapon.

661
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:35,848
Yours should match.

662
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:37,151
Narita Ryoichi,

663
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:39,968
I'm placing you under arrest.

664
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:55,842
- Phew.
- How can you say "phew"

665
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:58,889
Why do you always try to do everything by yourself?

666
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:06,878
You might really have been killed this time.

667
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:13,736
That's the first time.

668
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:16,789
The I've seen you get angry.

669
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,842
Is that all you can say?

670
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,912
But now I understand

671
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Katsuura is looking out for me.

672
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,693
I left a trail of clues

673
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,782
that I knew you'd notice.

674
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:54,293
Tsukiko-san.

675
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,363
Thank you, Katsuura.

676
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,231
Thanks.

677
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:02,201
- Thank you!
- Tsukiko, that hurts...

678
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,236
- Shibayama.
- Sir?

679
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:05,233
Let's go.

680
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,224
- And Otonashi?
- She can stay. 
- Sir.

681
00:43:09,294 --> 00:43:12,277
Ah, do you want to go for a meal tomorrow?

682
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:15,247
A mean for two?

683
00:43:15,317 --> 00:43:17,386
- Just two.
- Okay!

684
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:25,324
Ah... a message...

685
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,537
Huh? Oh,

686
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:28,444
it's mine.

687
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,333
It's from Mariko.

688
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,403
Huh?

689
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,324
Is your wife coming back?

690
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:44,394
You keep out of it!

691
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,231
Looks like my help wasn't needed after all.

692
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:52,304
No reason for us to come all this way.

693
00:43:54,273 --> 00:44:00,225
Until now, only one person has managed to
find the gold reserves.

694
00:44:00,295 --> 00:44:03,228
That wouldn't be Haruki, would it?

695
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:04,257
That's right.

696
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,134
He told Tsukiko about it, which got her interested.

697
00:44:09,204 --> 00:44:16,325
Chasing rumours...
She's an interesting woman, is Tsukiko-san.

698
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:18,395
You can say that again.

699
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:41,531
I knew it.

700
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,352
This is...

701
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:49,358
an urban myth... come true!

702
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:53,395
So you found it, then?

703
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:57,249
Takeshi dear.

704
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,305
Now that you know all about it...

705
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:10,329
Tsukiko, dear.

706
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:11,299
No...

707
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:13,449
Tsukiko!

708
00:45:16,405 --> 00:45:18,405
Sorry I'm late.

709
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,246
My sister has had to go to America.

710
00:45:27,316 --> 00:45:32,251
As part of the personnel exchanges with the FBI.

711
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:35,187
I see. So you came instead.

712
00:45:35,257 --> 00:45:37,222
That's fine.
Just fine.
Do you want to eat?

713
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,324
You should eat a lot, right?

714
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:42,394
Since you're still growing.
Eat what you want.

715
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,233
If Tsukiko doesn't want to have a meal
with me, she could think of a better excuse.

716
00:45:48,303 --> 00:45:50,369
- Shh.
- Who's that?

717
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:52,439
Quiet!

718
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,325
- Who is it?
- FBI.

719
00:45:56,395 --> 00:46:00,395
- Huh?
- Nice to meet you.

720
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:04,216
My name is Jodie Crone.

721
00:46:04,286 --> 00:46:06,301
You speak Japanese.

722
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:08,080
She's the real thing.

723
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:11,421
Languages are no problem for her.

724
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:17,316
So Tsukiko-san really went to America?

725
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:29,792
She's flown the nest!

726
00:47:04,246 --> 00:47:06,194
Good evening?

727
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:09,231
"Do you know this legend?"

728
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:12,234
That voice...?
Is this Haruki?

729
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:15,237
"It's not very well known but

730
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:17,172
they say that alligators live

731
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:20,429
in the sewers of New York."

732
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:28,403
Do you mean... this incident...

733
00:47:37,412 --> 00:47:44,412
It's heeeere!

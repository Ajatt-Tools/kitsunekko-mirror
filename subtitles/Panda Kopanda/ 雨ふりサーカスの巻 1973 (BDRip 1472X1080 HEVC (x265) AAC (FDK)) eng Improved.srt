Papa, Papa

00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:44,725
My great big, great big Papa

8
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:50,401
Let's stand on our heads
Let's smile and laugh

9
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:58,907
Because the three of us
are together and it's fun!

My Papa with his pipe

16
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:38,237
Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants

17
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:45,950
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!

“Dear Grandma,
How are you?”

20
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,436
“Papa, Pan and I are
all doing very well!”

21
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:19,444
“That's because we have
some terrific guests!”

22
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:22,485
“Who do you think
it is, Grandma?”

23
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,746
It's inside this house!

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,461
Seems like nobody's home.

25
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:33,663
No matter!

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,501
Let's hurry and take
it back!

27
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:42,008
Mr. Tiger! Here, Kitty kitty!

28
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,348
IS ANYBODY HOME?!

29
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,182
You'll scare away the tiger!

30
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,682
Mr. Tiger! Here, Kitty kitty!

31
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,186
Think it's okay, letting
ourselves in?

32
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,189
I don't like the look of this.

33
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,359
Mr. Tiger! Mr. Tiger!

34
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,823
Are you in here?

35
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,793
Nobody's here.

36
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,208
I'm sure he's here!

37
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:16,538
Let's look!

38
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:21,213
Ouch!

39
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:26,548
Boss!

40
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:27,557
Find him?

41
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,222
Take a look at this!

42
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:34,727
What are you doing?
Get looking for him!

43
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:39,020
It's just that I've never
seen one this small.

44
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,357
And there's a medium one.

45
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,733
Huh?

46
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,407
And this giant one!

47
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:55,707
Boss...

48
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:57,587
What now?

49
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:02,093
What kind of person would use
this monstrous tooth brush?

50
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:05,425
Start looking, or
I'll really get mad!

51
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:09,600
Now where could that tiger
have gotten to?

52
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:12,598
Th-That chair...!

53
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,183
That chair!

54
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:19,436
What kind of person would
have that monstrous chair?!

55
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,442
And that monstrous spoon!

56
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:25,278
That monstrous plate!

57
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,113
And what kind of thing
would eat a salad like this?

58
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,124
Boss, there's no doubt about it.

59
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:37,582
There's some kind of
great big thing living here.

60
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:39,955
Something like
a man-eating bear!

61
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,124
Maybe it even ate the tiger!

62
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:48,464
Huh?

63
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,760
A... A footprint!

64
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:58,482
Even a man-eating bear's
footprints aren't that big!

65
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,487
What is it?

66
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,949
I don't see anything.

67
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,953
It was... it was... this big!

68
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:26,335
Strange. I could've sworn
I saw it.

69
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:33,183
What?

70
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:35,515
T-tiny and r-round!

71
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,763
I don't see anything.

72
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:38,684
Huh?

73
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,197
Over there!

74
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,546
Welcome!

75
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:07,050
You guys are burglars, right?

76
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,132
This is great!

77
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:12,222
It's the first time I've
ever seen a burglar!

78
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,553
Wow! Wow!

79
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:21,520
Burglars! Burglars!

80
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,729
How do you do?

81
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:30,066
I'm Papa Panda.

82
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:42,831
Too bad.

83
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,581
Just when I finally got
to see real burglars...

84
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:48,550
They must be very busy.

85
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,174
Mama! Dinner!
Dinner!

86
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,263
Yes, I guess it's that time.

87
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,260
Let's eat!

88
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:01,229
Let's eat!

89
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,766
Let's eat!

90
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:09,442
Somebody ate it!

91
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,440
Somebody ate my curry!

92
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,239
You're right.

93
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:17,454
I wonder if those burglars ate it.

94
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:19,619
I'll get you some more.

95
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:27,756
I'm sure those burglars
must've been very hungry.

96
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,630
Just like me.

97
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:47,651
Someone used my towel
and got it all dirty.

98
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:52,614
Someone broke my trumpet!

99
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:15,971
Somebody's sleeping
in my bed.

100
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:51,168
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

101
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,231
Hey!

102
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,062
It's a tiger!

103
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,902
A baby tiger!

104
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:14,403
Oh...

105
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,416
This is my papa.

106
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,250
This is my mama.

107
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:34,250
Mine too! Mine too!

108
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:37,589
Wonderful!

109
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:41,223
After the burglars, a tiger
came to our house!

110
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:44,597
I'm Tiny.

111
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,432
I'm Pan.

112
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:51,267
Wow! Wow! Tiny! Tiny!

113
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:55,939
Wow! Wow! Pan! Pan!

114
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,113
This is good.

115
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:04,079
What a nice visitor.

116
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:07,449
Come on, let's all
have dinner together.

117
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,320
More, please!

118
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,480
Wow!

119
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:49,499
Ready... set...
here we... come!

120
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,837
We can't get out!

121
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,604
They're sleeping side-by-side.

122
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:12,848
Oh.

123
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:19,529
Hey, Papa?

124
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,532
I wonder where that tiger
came from?

125
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:25,368
I wonder if he has a mom?

126
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,835
I'll ask around in town,
tomorrow.

127
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:00,228
Papa!

128
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:02,526
Hi!

129
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,905
Papa! I'm going to run
some errands.

130
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:09,408
I wanna go, too!

131
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,894
Hang on a minute.

132
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,522
I'm just going to mail this.

133
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,615
Stay off the tracks!

134
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,116
I will.

135
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:48,617
Me too!

136
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,079
Mama!

137
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:06,586
Huh...?

138
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,010
I wonder where they went?

139
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,641
Pan!

140
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,478
Tiny!

141
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,640
Strange.

142
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,604
I wonder if they went
on ahead?

143
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:34,164
Mimiko! Did you know that
the circus is in town?

144
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,074
The circus?

145
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,950
Yeah!

146
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:39,327
It came in last night,
on the train!

147
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:42,088
Yeah, and there are lions
and all kinds of animals!

148
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,666
Hey, you wanna go?

149
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:47,753
Is there a tiger in that circus?

150
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,341
I dunno.

151
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:50,843
Probably!

152
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,178
Come on, let's go!

153
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,178
Then maybe Tiny belongs
to the circus...

154
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,396
Which means...

155
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:01,141
Well? Are you going, or what?

156
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:02,642
Sure, I'll go!

157
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:15,872
Oh, what a fix!

158
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,534
Where on earth could that
tiger have gotten to?

159
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,749
We've turned the place
upside-down.

160
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:25,291
And I had my fill of
that house last night.

161
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,854
Gee, a circus!

162
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,082
Huh...?

163
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:47,789
A panda!

164
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:50,963
After it!

165
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,638
It's that panda!

166
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,304
Stop!

167
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:30,332
Oh, no!

168
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:33,127
The tiger will
eat up the panda!

169
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,169
No way.

170
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,714
You children are naughty!

171
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:38,890
Come on, just a quick look!

172
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:40,508
Come on, just a little!

173
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,344
No, I said.
We're setting up.

174
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,354
Come back tomorrow and see.

175
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:47,140
And bring ticket money!

176
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:48,482
Not fair!

177
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:49,688
Mister!

178
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,061
Have you seen my panda, Pan?

179
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,022
Panda?

180
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,033
Yeah! The tiger and my panda
are lost!

181
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:02,864
Tiny!

182
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,328
Help!

183
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,952
A panda's gone into
the tiger's cage!

184
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,374
A panda?!

185
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:10,750
Hey, stop!

186
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,373
Get back here!

187
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:16,882
Come on...

188
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,720
That's a good girl,
let go of that panda.

189
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,970
Come on...

190
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,180
Come on, pandas don't
taste any good!

191
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:29,898
Please, let him out.

192
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,356
Please!

193
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:48,911
No, stop! Stop!

194
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:21,112
She's in danger!

195
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,978
Mama!

196
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,148
Mama!

197
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:56,444
This is my mommy!

198
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:58,362
This is my mommy!

199
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:08,789
Hello, you must be Tiny's mom.

200
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,827
I'm Mimiko, Pan's mom.

201
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:24,680
Great!

202
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,971
I'm so excited!

203
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:31,520
Hooray!

204
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,515
Tiny's back!

205
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,233
Hooray! Hooray!

206
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:36,309
Hooray!

207
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:55,704
How nice.

208
00:19:56,715 --> 00:20:02,381
The burglars, and Tiny, and
the circus folk were all wonderful.

209
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,298
Look! The boss gave us
some tickets, to thank us.

210
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,049
Let's all go tomorrow.

211
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:11,394
Wow! Wow! A circus! A circus!

212
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:14,397
Tiny's gonna be in the show
with his mom.

213
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:19,398
It's going to be very
nice weather tomorrow.

214
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,735
Oh...

215
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:22,397
Huh...?

216
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,191
Hey, is it raining?

217
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:28,573
Hurry, Papa!

218
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,204
Right.

219
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:10,449
I don't like the rain.
I don't like the rain.

220
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:13,115
I wonder if Tiny and
the others are getting wet.

221
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,782
They'll be okay.

222
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,705
Rain is important.
It makes living things stronger.

223
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,548
And it's especially good
for bamboo.

224
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:25,092
I don't like when it rains.

225
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,963
The circus will be cancelled.

226
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,472
Don't worry, I'm sure
it'll be nice out tomorrow.

227
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,055
Hey, let's have a snack.

228
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,306
A snack?

229
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,104
Here!

230
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,986
It's Tiny!

231
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:48,321
It's Tiny! It's Tiny!

232
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:55,330
“Dear Grandma,”

233
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:57,830
“The storm still hasn't passed.”

234
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:01,087
“The rain just pours down.”

235
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:04,002
“Pan is very disappointed.”

236
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,844
“I'm sure there's going to
be a big flood.”

237
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,682
“I wonder how Tiny
and the others are.”

238
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:20,189
“I'm very worried about them.”

239
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,236
Mama, I'm scared.

240
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:34,862
I'm right here.

241
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,281
Don't be afraid,
go to sleep.

242
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:39,534
Is Tiny okay?

243
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:40,543
Of course.

244
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,705
Tiny's mom is very strong,
after all.

245
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,171
I'm gonna give Tiny
my cookie!

246
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:50,716
Wow, I'm sure he'll
be surprised.

247
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:54,557
Now close your eyes.

248
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,765
Gee whiz!

249
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:39,226
Papa! Hurry and wake up!

250
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:43,560
Oh!

251
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:52,777
Papa, look!

252
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,157
Some fish!

253
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,040
Isn't this nice!

254
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:03,785
A nice flood.

255
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,372
And the bamboo is
especially nice.

256
00:24:18,977 --> 00:24:20,638
Papa!

257
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:21,973
Time for lunch!

258
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:24,642
Coming!

259
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:37,826
Here, help yourself.

260
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,329
Thank you.

261
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:49,380
Papa!

262
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,185
Papa!

263
00:25:18,454 --> 00:25:19,694
Yes?

264
00:25:20,414 --> 00:25:23,702
Since you're down there,
get some jam from the kitchen.

265
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:25,699
Sure.

266
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,582
Tiny! Tiny!

267
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:08,743
The circus ball.

268
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:12,750
So the circus must be
flooded, too.

269
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:29,930
What could this be?

270
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:31,769
Tiny! Tiny!

271
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,730
Read it! Read it!

272
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:36,904
These are Tiny's footprints,
but...

273
00:26:37,032 --> 00:26:42,277
It says, “Help, help!”
Signed, Tiny.

274
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:45,241
So they are having
trouble with all the water!

275
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:47,164
Papal! Let's save them!

276
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:55,923
Take this, Papa!

277
00:26:58,554 --> 00:26:59,464
Here.

278
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:00,753
Got it.

279
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:10,137
And we're off!

280
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:41,844
Isn't it nice, Papa?!

281
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,697
Look, the town looks like
an island!

282
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:18,922
Oh, it's Mimiko!

283
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:22,043
Boss, where are Tiny
and the others?

284
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:25,258
The animals were washed
away by the water.

285
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:27,218
Oh, that's terrible!

286
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:32,227
So you guys took off
without them?!

287
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:33,895
Well, uh...

288
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,228
We tried to get
them onto the train.

289
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,271
But the water came suddenly...

290
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:39,768
...and only the people escaped.

291
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,520
Gee!

292
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:43,405
Hey, Mimiko!

293
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:45,240
Hurry, Papa!

294
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:51,747
Poor Tiny and the others!

295
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:09,215
Over there!

296
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:22,938
Tiny! Tiny!

297
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,951
You're safe, now!

298
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,374
We're going to get you out!

299
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:36,708
We have food!

300
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:38,953
Just wait a bit longer!

301
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:47,719
Here!

302
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:51,637
It's me! A Tiny cookie!

303
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:55,595
It's going to get a little noisy.

304
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:07,485
Come on out.

305
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,326
There you are.

306
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:19,160
This is fun!

307
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:37,686
Nice, Papa!

308
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:39,145
My turn, next!

309
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,765
Here.

310
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:44,851
Here's some cabbage.

311
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:47,818
Carrots for Mr. Giraffe.

312
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:49,857
Ham!

313
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:53,035
Cookies for the horses!

314
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,206
I'm so excited!

315
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,541
Look, there's no water.

316
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,715
Huh?

317
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:11,105
We've gotta stop it, Papa!

318
00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:13,115
This is incredible!

319
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:17,278
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

320
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,460
Even more incredible!

321
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:46,140
Boss, did you hear a train?

322
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:47,311
Huh? Impossible.

323
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:52,271
See? I told you.

324
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:53,647
Don't be stupid.

325
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:55,782
Huh?

326
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,824
There it is!!

327
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:18,172
Papa, isn't this nice?!

328
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:23,518
Huh?

329
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:27,932
Hurry! Hurry!

330
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:20,359
Stop! Please stop!

331
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:23,370
Hi-ya!

332
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:53,100
Hurry! Get a move on!

333
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:55,773
Snap, snap! Get going!

334
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,772
Mimiko!

335
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,570
The brakes! The brakes!

336
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:04,620
I can't! I dunno which
one's the brake!

337
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:38,941
We're gonna crash!
We're gonna crash!

338
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:41,315
Papa, make us stop!

339
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:46,077
Please, Papa!

340
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:56,337
Papal!

341
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:18,852
Who's there?

342
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:21,480
Oh, Mr. Mayor.

343
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,527
Sorry about the racket.

344
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,993
You're the greatest, Papa!

345
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:56,515
“And so, Grandma,”

346
00:36:56,651 --> 00:37:02,237
“the people in town and from
the circus were very happy.”

347
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:07,239
“And we're even happier
than before, so don't worry.”

348
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,577
“Well, I'd better go.”

349
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:12,246
“Good-bye, Grandma.”

350
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,083
“Your granddaughter, Mimiko.”

351
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:21,172
Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants

352
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:25,590
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!

353
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:04,379
The End

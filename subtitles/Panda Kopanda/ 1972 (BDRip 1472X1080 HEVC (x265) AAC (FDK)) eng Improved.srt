Papa, Papa

00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,245
My great big, great big Papa

7
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:52,922
Let's stand on our heads
Let's smile and laugh

8
00:00:53,762 --> 00:01:01,260
Because the three of us
are together and it's fun!

Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants

16
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:48,106
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!

Hurry Grandma!

19
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,343
The train's coming!

20
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,303
Coming.

21
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,266
Here, this is your ticket
to Nagasaki.

22
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,184
And this is your lunch.

23
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,020
Don't get mixed up, now.

24
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,191
I sure hope you'll be okay
on your own, Mimiko.

25
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,446
Who, me?

26
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,439
I'll be fine.

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,532
Anyway, I've got school
so there's no choice.

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,544
No.

29
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,046
I just can't go.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,507
Grandpa's memorial service
is important.

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,378
But I just can't leave
you alone.

32
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,389
Oh, Grandma!
You're such a worry wart!

33
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,048
You have to get on!

34
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,685
Don't worry, I'll write
a letter every day.

35
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,553
Okay?

36
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,721
There.

37
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,734
See you later!

38
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:16,981
Mimiko!

39
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,401
Make sure you write
me every day!

40
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,701
Don't worry, I'll be fine!

41
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,237
See?

42
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,051
Hello, Mimiko.

43
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,594
Where's your Grandma?

44
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,088
She just left.

45
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,679
Um, I'd like some apples,
onions and potatoes, please.

46
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:48,551
Sure.

47
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,265
That means you'll be
all alone from tonight.

48
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,857
No problem!

49
00:03:55,986 --> 00:04:00,275
I can do the cooking,
cleaning and the wash!

50
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,940
What a good little girl.

51
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,405
Mimiko doesn't have
a father or mother.

52
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,278
But she doesn't seem lonely.

53
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,082
Aren't you gonna get scared
and cry, being alone at night?

54
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,575
I'll be just fine!

55
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,952
If I see a ghost, then...

56
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,624
Hi-yaah!

57
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,631
I'll beat him up and
make him my servant!

58
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,127
You sure are full
of energy, Mimiko.

59
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,179
Here, this one's on the house.

60
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,967
Thank you!

61
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,224
What a good little girl.

62
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,270
Actually, it's she who
takes care of Grandma.

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,152
Mimiko, I hear you're
on your own for a while.

64
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,692
That's no good.

65
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,785
What if a burglar gets
in your house?

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,320
Oh, that'd be great!

67
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,573
I've never seen a burglar before!

68
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,992
You got me there!

69
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,029
Hey... that's weird.

70
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,365
It wasn't like this
when I left.

71
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,364
I wonder if it's a burglar?!

72
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,876
Oh, boy.

73
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,545
Somebody was definitely
here while I was out.

74
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,381
I'm sure this bucket was
put away properly before.

75
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,050
Oh, boy!!!

76
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,893
Wow, a cute stuffed panda!

77
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,917
Wow!

78
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,258
I'm sure you and I
are going to be friends!

79
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,768
Wow!

80
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,434
My very first visitor
is a panda!

81
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,137
Come on in.

82
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,102
Wait here, and I'll
get us some drinks.

83
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,808
Ups-a-daisy!

84
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,656
There you are.

85
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,207
What a cute way to drink!

86
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,345
Papa!

87
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,468
Papa!

88
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,345
I don't see anybody.

89
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,472
Oh, someone's here.

90
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,144
Hang on a second.

91
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,355
Come in!

92
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,196
Thank you, I will.

93
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,198
What a nice house.

94
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,858
The weather's nice too.

95
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,528
And the bamboo grove
is especially nice.

96
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:25,370
I've come to see if
my son Pan is here.

97
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,670
I thought so!

98
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,711
So you're the panda's father!

99
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,216
Come in.

100
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,548
I've just made drinks.

101
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,052
Please don't trouble yourself.

102
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,599
I guess this seat really
didn't like being sat upon.

103
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,190
I'm sure this seat will
want you to sit on it!

104
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,568
Now this is a nice seat.

105
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,991
The kitchen is nice, too.

106
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,206
And the bamboo grove
is especially nice!

107
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,911
Which reminds me...

108
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,923
I should greet your parents.

109
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,422
No need to do that.

110
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,588
Because I don't have
a mom or dad!

111
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,260
What?!

112
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,220
You don't have a dad?!

113
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,098
That won't do.

114
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,762
But I'm just fine.

115
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,435
I can get along on my own.

116
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,103
No siree.

117
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,111
In order to raise children,
there have to be parents.

118
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,115
Like you need a bamboo grove
to grow bamboo shoots.

119
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,080
It'd probably be better
to have them.

120
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,789
What a nice bamboo grove!

121
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,749
I know!

122
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,214
Why don't I become
your father?

123
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,583
Pardon?!

124
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,637
It's hard for a father
to become a mother.

125
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,923
But it's easy to become
a father!

126
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,800
Nothing to it.

127
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,389
I'm already a papa.

128
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,140
So it'd be nothing for me
to become a father!

129
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,655
I'd like even just one father!

130
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,324
Mr. Panda! Be my father!

131
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,167
And in turn, I'll be
Pan's mama!

132
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,004
Okay?

133
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,505
Then the three of us will
live here in this house!

134
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,968
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

135
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,338
Mama! Mama!

136
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,677
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

137
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,807
Mama! Mama!

138
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,346
Mama!

139
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,347
That's nice of you.

140
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,231
Pan's always wanted a mama.

141
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,023
Papa!

142
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,028
Yes?

143
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,695
A dad wears a hat, you know!

144
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,203
And a dad reads a newspaper
at home.

145
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,323
And he smokes a pipe.

146
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,715
Thank you...

147
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,054
You're very welcome!

148
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,720
And daddies...

149
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,056
Um, a dad...

150
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,560
A dad gives hugs, too!

151
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,402
Okay!

152
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,071
Papa!

153
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,067
Papa!

154
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,036
Yes, little girl.

155
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,330
That's weird,
calling me “little girl”.

156
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,244
Call me “Mimiko”.

157
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,908
Huh?

158
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,207
Mimiko.

159
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,042
Papa.

160
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,747
Mama.

161
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,417
What is it, Pan?

162
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,085
Mama's right here.

163
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,929
Isn't this nice.

164
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,594
It truly is.

165
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,514
And the bamboo grove
is especially nice!

166
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,600
The bamboo grove...?

167
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,935
Oh, I know!

168
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,116
What a nice bamboo grove.

169
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,781
Yes, I'm coming.

170
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,282
Got one!

171
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,243
Mine, too!

172
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,799
Very nice!

173
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,142
Is it good?

174
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,068
This is great!

175
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,158
It's the happiest day
of my life!

176
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,507
Standing on your head
when you're happy.

177
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,969
That's truly a fun thing to do.

178
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,107
“Dear Grandma, How are you?”

179
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,852
“I'm doing great.”

180
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,026
“Because something really
terrific happened.”

181
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,861
“I got myself a daddy!”

182
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,694
“And I also got a baby.”

183
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,031
“Right now Papa's reading
a picture book upside-down...”

184
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,199
“...while he eats some bamboo.”

185
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,493
“Pan's sleepy.”

186
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,042
“I'll have to get his bed ready.”

187
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,882
“Well, I'd better get going.”

188
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,217
“Being a mother is wonderful,
and it keeps you busy.”

189
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,386
“Take care.”

190
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,722
“Bye, Grandma.”

191
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,013
“Love from your granddaughter,
Mimiko.”

192
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,921
Pan!

193
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,084
Breakfast is almost ready,
so don't go too far!

194
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,092
Get up, Papa.

195
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,424
Hurry or you'll be
late for work!

196
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,214
Work...?

197
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,762
Huh?

198
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,901
Eat up!

199
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,410
All right, then.

200
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,118
Ouch!

201
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,119
Here's your lunch, Papa.

202
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,960
And this is your lunch.

203
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,629
My lunch! My lunch!

204
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,420
Oh! Your hat, Papa!

205
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,347
Here!

206
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,597
Huh?

207
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,977
Language, math...

208
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,392
When you say “Papa has
to go to work”...

209
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,940
...are you talking about me?

210
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,732
Sure!

211
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,482
A dad goes to work
every morning!

212
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,825
Papa!

213
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,569
I wanna go to work, too!

214
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,820
Work! Work!

215
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,160
Papa's going to work...?

216
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,325
Work...?

217
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,162
That's right!

218
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,080
How could I have forgotten?!

219
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,332
Today's a day off!

220
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,675
I'm sure of it!

221
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,011
Yes, that's right.

222
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,506
It's always a day off.

223
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,179
So I don't have to
go to work.

224
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,177
A day off!

225
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,435
Let's go! Let's go!

226
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,645
Let's go for a walk!

227
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,847
We can't.

228
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,515
I've gotta go to school.

229
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,478
No!

230
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,022
I wanna go to school, too!

231
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,029
Don't be like that, or
I'll spank your bottom.

232
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,439
I don't wanna be spanked.

233
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,983
Be a good boy.

234
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,200
See you later!

235
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,369
Bye! Have a good day!

236
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,377
Oh!

237
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,051
Pan, did you follow me?

238
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,846
You can't come.

239
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,885
Go home.

240
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,021
You've gotta be bigger
to go to school.

241
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,739
You can't come!

242
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,571
Uh-oh!

243
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,535
School's about to start!

244
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,413
Oh, brother.

245
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:23,748
In that case...

246
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,908
Listen, Pan.

247
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,330
Act like a stuffed animal.

248
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,079
I'll take you if you promise
not to be naughty.

249
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,252
Okay. I'm a stuffed animal.

250
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:40,261
“And after a little while,
another tiger appeared.”

251
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:45,012
“The tiger said,
I'll eat you up!”

252
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,435
Mimiko, your stuffed panda
sure is cute!

253
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,107
Yeah.

254
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,773
Let me hold it for a while.

255
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,565
No.

256
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,606
Selfish!

257
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,524
Just for a minute!

258
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,747
“I walk on four feet.”

259
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,036
Please!

260
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,283
Mimiko!

261
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,791
Let me see!

262
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:11,955
No!

263
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,587
What did you bring
a stuffed animal for?

264
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,301
I'm telling the teacher!

265
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,794
Ouch!

266
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,971
Mimiko!

267
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,682
Yes?

268
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,306
Stand up!

269
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,311
Mimiko, what are you
hiding behind that book?

270
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,822
A stuffed panda!
Isn't he cute?

271
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,825
What a well-made panda.

272
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,826
You shouldn't be bringing
stuffed animals to class!

273
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,993
Now, get rid of it!

274
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:48,992
But...

275
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,836
Put it in the shoe locker
until school's out.

276
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,337
Understand?

277
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,331
Yes.

278
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,007
Okay, Pan.
Stay here and be quiet.

279
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,263
I'll come to get you
as soon as school's out.

280
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,008
Okay, I'll be right here.

281
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,176
Don't be naughty!

282
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,721
I won't be naughty.

283
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,515
Oh, dear!

284
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,729
You didn't put it
away properly!

285
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,473
Now all this bread
has gone to waste!

286
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,226
Oh! What's a rice cake
doing here?

287
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,664
What?!!

288
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,249
A bear!

289
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,263
That's all for today.

290
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,261
Huh?

291
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,471
Oh, no! That's Pan!

292
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,264
A bear! Catch it!

293
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,285
Mama!

294
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,458
Mimiko!
Did a bear come this way?

295
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,952
Look, teacher!

296
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,456
I washed my panda off.
It's nice and clean.

297
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,467
No, not a panda!
A bear! A yellow bear!

298
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,839
Oh, it went that way.

299
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,639
“And of course, Grandma...”

300
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:17,642
“...when we got home,
I scrubbed him clean.”

301
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,481
“Because he smelled
like curry.”

302
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,736
“He was a curry panda.”

303
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,324
“Of course, I had to
scold him.”

304
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,321
“It sure is hard, having
a small child.”

305
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,994
“Take care now.”

306
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,507
Where are you off to,
Mr. Officer?

307
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,501
Hello.

308
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,844
I thought I'd go
check in on Mimiko.

309
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,676
Grandma isn't back yet,
is she.

310
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,801
No, and I'm worried about
Mimiko being on her own.

311
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,302
See you later.

312
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,531
Hello, Mimiko.

313
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,365
Hello!

314
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,201
It's open!

315
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,531
Hello!

316
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,709
We have a guest,
so stay over there.

317
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,213
What was that?!

318
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,215
Papa and Pan.

319
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,545
“Papa”...?!

320
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,047
A pa...pa...pa...pa!

321
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:31,843
Yes?

322
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,889
Did you call for Papa?

323
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,565
Boy, what a rude policeman.

324
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,905
He was surprised
that I have a dad!

325
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,448
Hurry and let's go
for a walk!

326
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,909
All right, let's go!

327
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,223
Ouch!

328
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,130
That's strange.

329
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,626
I'm sure there was a great
big panda and a little one.

330
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,305
A panda and its child
were here, right?!

331
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,468
Hello, Mr. Zookeeper.

332
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,634
It was definitely Papa Panda
and his famliy!

333
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,261
Hurry and catch them!

334
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,480
I've been worried about
them for days...

335
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,771
...ever since they escaped
from our zoo!

336
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,820
Yes, I read about it
in the paper and on TV.

337
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,732
But who would've thought
they'd be in Mimiko's house...!

338
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,650
I'm counting on you!

339
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,501
Wow! It's beautiful!

340
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,510
This air is delicious!

341
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,843
This pipe is delicious!

342
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,352
Papa!

343
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,847
Papa!

344
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,857
Come and skip!

345
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,023
Oh, a jump rope!

346
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,657
Jump in!

347
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,335
Oh, pandas!

348
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,629
Must be the ones that
escaped from the zoo!

349
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:21,051
I won't let you say
bad things about my dad!

350
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,395
Your dad? That's stupid.

351
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:29,230
That's the famous panda
that escaped from the zoo!

352
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,564
Don't you have a TV at home?

353
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,231
Whoever catches them
will get a reward!

354
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,739
Papa...

355
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,154
Hey, hurry and go
tell the cops.

356
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,248
I'll watch them!

357
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,590
Papa!

358
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,092
But I wanted to keep jumping.

359
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,425
No, stop!

360
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,000
Look out, Pan!

361
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,299
Pan!

362
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,092
Ow...

363
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,648
Neat-o!

364
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,818
I'm giving him back.

365
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,290
You're strong, Pan!

366
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,917
Papa...?

367
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,006
A z00...?

368
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,014
We were there
a long, long time ago.

369
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,846
But they didn't have
a nice bamboo grove.

370
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,852
And you weren't there.

371
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,180
But when they come
to take you back...

372
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,689
...they'll take Pan, too.

373
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,685
Oh, where did Pan go?

374
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,654
Pan!

375
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,535
Pan!

376
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,659
Pan!

377
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,041
Where are you?

378
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,378
Pan!

379
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,002
Pan...

380
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,138
Hello, Papa Panda.

381
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,101
Lovely day.

382
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,063
And I'm delighted to see
you looking so well.

383
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:18,236
And I'm delighted to see
you so well too, Mr. Zookeeper.

384
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,069
I'd like your cooperation in
accompanying us back to the zoo.

385
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,574
We have the car ready.

386
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:25,993
Oh, my.

387
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,407
How kind of you.

388
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,538
Then you'll come back?

389
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,248
No, Papa!

390
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,912
We've gotta look for Pan!

391
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,247
That's true.

392
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,583
You'll have to excuse me.

393
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,087
“Pan”...? The baby panda!

394
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,092
Oh, no!

395
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,594
Everyone look for the baby panda!

396
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,929
Pan!

397
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,933
Pan!

398
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,610
We've been looking and looking.

399
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,067
Where could he be?

400
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,031
Hey! He's over there!

401
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,122
Oh, no!

402
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,867
There's a floodgate ahead!

403
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,118
A what?!
We've gotta move!

404
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,879
Pan!

405
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,466
Papa! Mama!

406
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,800
Pan!

407
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,465
Mama!

408
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,886
Hang on tight!

409
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,283
It's no use!

410
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,827
It's rusted and won't budge!

411
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,493
Pan!

412
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,374
Mama!

413
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,462
No, don't!

414
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,792
Let me go!

415
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,381
You'll die, too!

416
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,027
Mimiko! Hang on!

417
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,033
Papa!

418
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,365
Coming!

419
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,826
Hurry, Papa!

420
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,165
I can't hold on!

421
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,871
It's all over!

422
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,040
Mimiko...!

423
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,069
Hooray!

424
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,259
Oh! Isn't that nice!

425
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,279
“Dear Grandma,
How are you?”

426
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:01,075
“Papa and Pan have
gone back to the zoo.”

427
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,287
PANDA GARDEN ENTRANCE

428
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,128
Good night.

429
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,465
See you tomorrow.

430
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,642
“Papa's very happy
going to work.”

431
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,983
“After all, dads are
supposed to go to work.”

432
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,563
“Papa buys me presents
with the money he makes.”

433
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:37,111
‘Anyway, I'm very happy,
so don't worry.”

434
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,837
Papa!

435
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,843
Welcome back!

436
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:29,876
The End

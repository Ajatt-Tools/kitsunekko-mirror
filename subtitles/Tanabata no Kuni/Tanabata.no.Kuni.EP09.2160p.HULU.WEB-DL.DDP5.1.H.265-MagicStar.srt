00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,092
I find myself in a deep darkness.

175
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:09,651
From that moment, I'm all alone.

176
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,035
For a thousand years…

For ten thousand years…

I'm trapped in a dark place, all alone.

I feel something.

Even though I'm dead and all alone,

00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,690
there's somebody there.

It's like that person…

I don't know why, but…

Your brother…

that he was sorry.

204
00:17:56,693 --> 00:18:01,285
[Nanmaru] He showed up out of the blue,
so I didn't quite understand at first.

205
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,043
But I think…

206
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:09,594
that they were his true feelings.

It doesn't matter…

I just…

00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:42,242
I hope he hasn't gone
to the lonely place by himself.

I've heard all about it.

I understand you have come here

for Professor Marukami's whereabouts.

I realized that the order of the schedule

and the flag was reversed.

I mentioned it to the townspeople,

223
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:34,012
but they said it would be strange
to change it after all this time,

224
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:38,939
so we'll continue as things are

[villager 1] Isn't that a bit conspicuous?

250

It's scary how the devastation

251
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:24,984
at the Higashimaru estate
is being wrapped up as a serial killing.

252

That wasn't a crime scene…

253

It was a battlefield.

And this incident
hasn't been in the news at all.

[Aki] Not even on the Internet.

256
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,058
Does that mean
information is being suppressed?

257
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:42,645
Right.

258
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:46,193
I even tried posting about it
on social media with a throwaway account,

259

but I got banned immediately.

Which means only the people of this town

Uh-huh.

You could call this

That's why we must meet him first,

behind his extreme actions.

We need to avoid the worst-case scenario,

[Professor Marukami] First, a recap.

587
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:36,822
It is estimated that the origin
of the Marukami Village festival

588
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:40,622
dates back to the mid-Heian period,
and it seems that it was already

589
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:43,628
a seven-day festival
from a very early stage.

590
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,634
But why seven days?

591
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:50,265
[Tagaya] It's the seven days
that include the summer solstice, right?

592
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,522
[Emi] We found that out from your letter.

593
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:54,775
Right.

594
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:56,361
What about the other thing?

595
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:58,240
We didn't get that at all.

596
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:02,582
The order of the festival schedule
and the flag is reversed.

597
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,297
First, this is about it
being called Tanabata, right?

598
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:08,051
Precisely.

599
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:12,769
The festival in this town is now known
as the "June Tanabata Festival,"

600
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:15,650
which is very rare even nationwide,

601
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,323
but it only started being called that
from the late Edo period onwards.

602
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:20,450
What?

603
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:25,460
"Tanabata" wasn't mentioned at all
in any of the previous records.

[Professor Marukami] Tanabata.

606
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,724
Originally,

607
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:35,147
this was written

608
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:37,902
with the characters

609
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,577
"shelf" and "loom."

610
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,666
But characters describing the
"evening of July 7th" were used instead.

611
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,461
Just remember that the characters

612
00:42:46,545 --> 00:42:49,216
for "seven" and "evening"
were attached later on.

613
00:42:50,762 --> 00:42:52,431
Now then, Professor Emi.

614
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:56,899
Please explain what I mean
about the order of the festival schedule

615
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,401
and the flag being reversed.

[♪ suspenseful music playing]

617
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:04,080
Okay.

618
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:17,816
Now then,

619
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:22,742
we were initially considering this issue
with Tanabata in mind.

620
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,832
This is because of the Kasasagi flag.

621
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,840
In the Chinese story
that inspired Tanabata,

622
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:33,556
a Kasasagi is depicted as a bird
that forms a bridge across the Milky Way.

623
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,812
Thus, we first thought that,

624
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:41,320
since the Tanabata legend came from China,

625
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:48,501
the bird associated with Tanabata,
the Kasasagi…

626
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,388
became a symbol on the lord's flag.

627
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:01,277
We then thought
it became a seven-day festival…

628
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:09,502
due to the character "seven"
in the word Tanabata.

629
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:16,390
However, it turns out
this order is entirely reversed.

630
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:22,779
[board eraser screeching]

631
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:29,960
A seven-day festival
and the Kasasagi flag existed first.

632
00:44:32,715 --> 00:44:34,845
Due to the match between the "seven days,"

633
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:40,313
and "Kasasagi,"
a bird associated with Tanabata…

634
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:49,791
the festival later became known
as the "Tanabata Festival."

635
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:58,767
But Kasasagis weren't even present
in this region of Tohoku,

636
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:02,482
let alone in Japan during the Heian period
when the festival started, right?

637
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:06,407
So what exactly do you mean

638
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,746
by the Kasasagi flag existing first?

639
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,500
That's the point.

640
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:17,847
Initially, it might not have been called
the Kasasagi flag.

641
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:20,060
In other words,

642

it might never have been
a Kasasagi at all,

…and line them up like this…

664
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:46,357
What does it look like?

665
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:53,287
[Nanmaru] The Kasasagi flag?

666
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,709
[Professor Marukami] That's right.

667
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,424
This is probably the original form.

668
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:01,428
It looks like the upper hand

669
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:04,184
is giving something round
to the lower hand.

670
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:06,272
[♪ dramatic music playing]

671
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:09,612
Everything started with this.

672
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:15,206
[♪ ominous music playing]

00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:19,841
[dripping]

674
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,232
[Professor Marukami]
Now then, about the model.

675
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:31,488
Tagaya, did you notice anything
while making this?

676
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,034
Well…

677
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:39,338
Mount Marukami and the Seven Peaks
felt somewhat artificial, I guess.

678
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:41,593
-[Nanmaru] You did mention that before.
-Uh-huh.

679
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:45,058
As I mentioned earlier,
the Marukami festival

680
00:47:45,141 --> 00:47:47,605
is held over seven days,
encompassing the summer solstice.

681
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:51,237
On the day of the summer solstice,
the sun rises and sets

682
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,032
at its most northern points.

683
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:58,752
In this village, the sun always sets
along the ridge line of Mount Kurone,

684
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,004
but if you look here,

685
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:04,555
the north face of Mount Kurone
is greatly eroded, forming quite a cliff.

686
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:08,522
[Professor Marukami]
Since Mount Kurone is so high,

687
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:11,653
this place usually experiences
early sunsets,

688
00:48:11,736 --> 00:48:14,408
but during the seven days
around the summer solstice,

689
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:18,792
from very specific spots,
you can witness a second sunset.

690
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,548
This is thanks to this gap.

691
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:25,723
A second sunset…

692
00:48:29,522 --> 00:48:31,191
Haven't you realized something?

693
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:38,582
A second sunset, for seven days only…

694
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,003
Oh.

695
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,842
A seven-day

696
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:45,846
sunset.

697
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,645
Tanabata…

698
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:55,949
Not the sunset of July 7th,

699
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,578
but seven sunsets!

700
00:48:58,245 --> 00:48:59,999
I see…

701
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:03,924
So "seven" and "evening" came from there,
making it the Tanabata Festival.

702
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:07,055
[all exclaim]

703
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:13,735
Everyone, line up over there.

704
00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:17,701
-Okay.
-Okay.

705
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:20,414
If you would, Sachiko.

706
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,335
Okay.

707
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:27,178
[switch clicks]

708
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:30,853
Think of this light

709
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:35,319
as the sun that provides the second sunset
on the day of the summer solstice.

710
00:49:35,403 --> 00:49:36,405
All right.

711
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:40,789
When the sun sets for a second time…

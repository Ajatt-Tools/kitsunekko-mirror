In the early hours of October 13th,

00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,800
near Kamiseta in Tokyo's Setagaya Ward,

for this series of huge explosions.

[Mr. Shikishima] First…

153
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,768
Considering the scale
of the terrorist attack

154
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:22,274
and the explosive devices involved,
it's likely that a terrorist group

155
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:26,867
of a few to several dozen people
are behind this.

156
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:31,544
[host] Does such a large criminal
organization actually exist in Japan?

157
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,255
[Mr. Shikishima]
Since no such organization…

158
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,009
I'm in Marukawa Town!

00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:38,473
I'll find out the truth
these townspeople are hiding!

160
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,021
This is an entirely new organization.

161
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:44,152
However, it's hard to imagine
that such a major crime

162
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,657
could be organized in such a short time.

that occurred in the city, but the police
have yet to identify the suspect

177
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,378
[Mr. Hayano] Good morning.

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

179

It takes about 30 minutes on foot
to reach the Higashimaru estate.

00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,061
[Emi] Okay.

181
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,735
Um… where is Professor Marukami?

182
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:33,908
[exclaims, inhales sharply]
It seems he's going to be a little late.

183
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,494
He'll head straight to the estate.

184
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,542
Okay.

185
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,963
I'm excited to see Professor Marukami.

186
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,009
-I wonder if he's changed.
-Not sure…

-What?

Uh… Nothing at all.
Come on, let's head off.

-Ah.

Good morning.

Did you sleep well?

-Yeah, thank you.
-Not at all.

[Nanmaru] How about you?

198
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:21,002
[Sachiko] I didn't sleep much.

199
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:24,216
[Nanmaru] I see. That makes sense.

Wouldn't it be bad if there's a commotion
and all the townspeople show up?

00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,764
[Yoriyuki] We'll be gone before then.

203

If you're scared,
then just be ready to run away.

205
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:27,844
[Yoriyuki] Nothing.

206

Where's the old man?

207
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,396
[Takashi] Well,
I hardly come here myself recently.

208
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,275
[Yoriyuki] Jeez, you're hopeless.

209
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,739
-This is the Higashimaru estate, right?
-[Takashi] Sorry.

210
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,661
[housekeeper splutters]
Master Yoriyuki…

211
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,957
[Yoriyuki] Is the retired master well?

212
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,128

Yes, sir.

Is somebody here already?

216
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:00,534
It's still a little early.

217
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,624
[Yoriyuki] Long time no see.

218
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,085
Hey there.

219
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,297
Yoriyuki…

220
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,301
Takashi…

221
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,140
I'll bring some tea.

222
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,309
Sit!

223
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:18,862
[Takashi] Good.

224
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:32,013
Did you kill that construction worker?

225
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:38,819
[Yoriyuki] I couldn't allow an outsider
to destroy Mount Marukami.

226
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:45,916
I've realized that no matter how far I go,

227
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,171
I cannot escape this land
and gain freedom.

228
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:51,051
[Yoriyuki] Not unless I overturn
the basic principles.

229
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:57,189
Does coming here mean
that you've found your answer?

230
00:18:57,272 --> 00:18:58,399
[Yoriyuki] Precisely.

231
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:02,658
I'm putting an end to the nightmares.

232
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,583
[Sachiko's great-uncle]
What are you planning to do on this land?

233
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,837
[Yoriyuki] Just one thing.

234
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,091
That is to break the current stalemate.

235
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,601
You're no longer in your right mind.

236
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,481
You seem desperate.

237
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,401
[Yoriyuki scoffs]
Perhaps.

238
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:23,909
Or perhaps I'll uncover
the sheer foolishness

239
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,746
of this village's age-old ways.

240
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,550
Surely… you won't…

241
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,639
[Yoriyuki]
This concludes my final farewell.

242
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:35,808
I'll take my leave now.

243
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,354
It would be a hassle
to run into the townsfolk.

244
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:40,275
Wait, Yoriyuki.

245
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:41,862
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,953
[Yoriyuki] Send my regards
to Professor Marukami or whatever.

247
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,459
See you, Great-uncle.

248
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,479
[Yoriyuki] Takashi, you were right.

249

Huh?

250
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:06,661
[Yoriyuki] I'm sorry
things turned out like this.

00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,001
What? What are you talking about?

[Yoriyuki] Takashi, come with me.

00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,059
Is somebody here?

254

260
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,411
Right. The air is different here.

[laughter]

263

It seems the townspeople hate me.

264
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,262
You think so?

265
00:20:57,345 --> 00:21:00,978
Yeah, because I spoke badly
about Yoriyuki.

00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:07,825
I don't think they hate you though.

269
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,457
They're afraid.

270
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,294
Of you.

271
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,131
Huh?

272
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:20,768
They heard it as a command.

273
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,776
At their core, everyone is a vassal.

274
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,708
They have a sense of fear
toward the lord's bloodline.

275
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,547
-They're afraid.
-[Tagaya] A little farther?

276
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:36,758
-A little farther?
-[Mr. Hayano] Yes.

277
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,094
[Tagaya] I see.

278
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:44,064
By the way,
who made that model of Marukami Village?

279
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,734
That was me.

280
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:48,615
I see. That was you, was it?

281
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:52,748
I must say,
all the townsfolk were impressed.

282
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:55,127
It was incredibly detailed.

-[chuckles]
-You think so? Thank you very much.

284

Even Professor Marukami
said that the model

285
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:04,020
helped him solve a difficult problem.

286
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,816
Professor Marukami said that?

287
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:06,985
[Mr. Hayano] That's right.

288
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,991
Although he never said what that was.

[Sachiko] Only you…
are going Beyond the Window.

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:09,227
[Emi] It might look different this time,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,066
but the same thing that happened
400 years ago could be happening again.

5
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:16,032
I think that might be
a bit of an exaggeration.

6
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,117
Professor Marukami…

7
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,996
[Professor Marukami] Let's make a deal.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,877
We won't leave here ever again.

9
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,841
You hope to persuade Yoriyuki Marukami?

10
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,012
If persuasion is enough…

11
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:30,269
The order is reversed… I get it now.

12
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:33,943
Everything started with this.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,869
[Professor Marukami]
When the sun sets for a second time…

14
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:40,957
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

15
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:49,056
[Emi] Is this the Kasasagi flag?

16
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,854
A section of ground surface,

17
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,066
lit up by the second sunset.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,154
[♪ pensive music playing]

19
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,370
The round summit of Mount Marukami

20
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:02,082
is the central circle.

21
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:06,132
[Professor Marukami]
The ridge that extends

22
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:09,305
from Mount Kurone to Mount Marukami
forms the shape of a human hand.

23
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:12,812
The complex terrain of the Seven Peaks

24
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,777
conjures up a shape resembling Kasasagi.

25
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,832
Aligned with light,
from a singular fixed direction,

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,588
everything has been perfectly calculated.

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,426
Based on the angle and direction
of the mountain slopes

28
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:34,856
and the overlapping ridgelines,
and then carved into terrain

29
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,405
that withstands the harsh winds and snow.

30
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:44,543
[Professor Marukami] It's a vast
and magnificent sculpture of the earth,

31
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:47,381
spanning several square kilometers.

32
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:52,725
Of course, it would be impossible
for humans to achieve such a feat.

33
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:56,065
Then, who made it?

34
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:58,904
You could call them ancestors,

35
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,159
or even patron deities.

36
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,501
But let's assume
that the Kasasagis created this terrain.

37
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:09,049
There are hardly any records left,

38
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,345
so I will include my own conjectures here.

39
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,477
I believe that 1,000 years ago,

40
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:18,067
the Kasasagis appeared in this area.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,621
From the sky, for instance.

42
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,762
[♪ ambient music playing]

43
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,933
[Professor Marukami]
How might people have reacted

44
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:36,103
upon seeing the Kasasagis?

45
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:42,407
[♪ ambient music continues]

46
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,708
This is the land of myriad gods.

47
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,591
Regardless of whether their superhuman
abilities and unusual appearances

48
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,971
were considered good or bad,

49
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:55,768
they would surely have been deemed divine.

50
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:02,489
And the Kasasagis, having become gods,

51
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:06,205
began to visit this land regularly.

52
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:11,299
Regularly?

53
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,892
Several folk tales
from this region mention that,

54
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:21,862
"The year a god descends upon the mountain
will surely be a year of great harvest."

55
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:27,164
Now assume that this mountain
refers to Mount Marukami.

56
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:31,297
Doesn't it start to resemble
something like a helipad?

57
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,552
[Nanmaru] I see.

58
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,806
Which means,

59
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,646
the torches from the festival were like…

60
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:41,192
guide lights?

61
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:49,416
The festival began
as a ceremony to welcome the gods,

62
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,381
and it began around the summer solstice.

63
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,055
[Professor Marukami] But at some point,

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,729
the Kasasagis
stopped appearing altogether.

65
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:04,531
Still, people continued
the festival every year.

66
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,119
Year after year…

67
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:10,041
For 1,000 years.

68
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:14,759
No matter how long they wait,
the one they wish to meet does not appear.

69
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,811
Just like the Tanabata story.

70
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:26,575
The fact that they still eagerly await
the Kasasagis, and even now,

71
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:30,624
continue the sacred mountain rituals,

72
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,630
shows that they truly worship them.

73
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,441
[Professor Marukami] Would you agree?

74
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:49,954
The feeling that everyone in the town,
including you, must protect the mountain…

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,423
Do you think it truly stems
from respect for those things?

76
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,553
"Those things…"

77
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:04,901
I think it's because of what you said.

78
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,368
"The invisible chains…

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,251
wrapped around our necks."

80
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,006
Chains?

81
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:21,726
The Window…

82
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,903
[Professor Marukami breathes heavily]

83
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:29,032
That's what…

84
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:31,997
Beyond the Window is.

85
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,380
Unbearable fear and loneliness.

86
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:40,598
These things were instilled
in the Window Openers.

87
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:44,146
Window Openers like myself and Sachiko
are compelled to wait

88
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,112
for the Kasasagis here on this land,
as they occasionally appear in our dreams

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,743
and reach out to us.

90
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,374
[♪ light music playing]

91
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:18,882
[Professor Marukami] Which means

92
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,682
we have been chained.

93
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,781
Fear and loneliness…

94
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,624
Chained up by the Kasasagis…

95
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:47,857
1,000 years ago…

96
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:55,831
the Kasasagis spread the Ability to Reach
and the fear of seeing Beyond the Window,

97
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:59,129
within the blood of the humans
who lived in this land.

98
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,179
[Nanmaru] How did they do that?

99
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,770
This is just speculation…

100
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,567
but perhaps the Kasasagis

101
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:12,405
considered settling in this place,

102
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:15,913
or maybe it was a site
for their experiments.

103
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,223
[Professor Marukami]
Then, they tamed the creatures

104
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:31,276
that lived there as their loyal servants,
and even tested whether they could be used

105
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:35,368
as material
for their own breeding experiments.

Surely not…

108
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:57,663
That spoiled the wonder of the story.

109
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:04,259
[Professor Marukami]
Now, ask yourself this…

110
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:10,606
Why would they carve
this huge Kasasagi flag into the mountain?

111
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,780
Perhaps to use it as a signpost
for when they arrive.

112
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,450
[Tagaya] Something like that?

113
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,039
Would those
with such terrifying technology

114
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:21,961
rely on the light of sunset as a signpost?

115
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:26,178
A signpost that can't even be seen
through clouds or rain?

116
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,890
[Tagaya mutters]

117
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,434
I suppose not.

118
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:35,112
I'd say the Kasasagi flag
that appears here

119
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,283
is a test of loyalty.

A reminder to never leave this land.

To repel outside interference,

122
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,934
reserve the terrain,
and await their arrival.

123

That's what the weapon
known as the Ability to Reach is for.

[villager 1] Mr. Minamimaru,
do you want seconds?

00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,509
[Nanmaru] No, I'm fine.

183
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,972
[villager 2] Oh, right,

we might run out of firewood soon.

185
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:07,777
[villager 3] I'll let the next group know.

do you plan to take over
after Professor Marukami?

188

No, I don't think so.

189
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,517

190
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,437
That's a shame.

I see.

00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:23,846
Besides,

212
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,438
I was the one who said
we should meet Yoriyuki first.

213
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:34,200
But do you think he will really come?

[villager 1] Is that right? Oh, yeah.

215

-Thank goodness.
-Thank you so much.

219
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,418
On the evening of the summer solstice,

220
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,097
you can only see the giant Kasasagi flag
by looking from the sky above.

221
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,602
Most of the townspeople
don't know about it.

222
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,486
[Professor Marukami]
All that remains is the old lore

223
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:15,490
that tells the townspeople
to protect the land.

224
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:17,954
However,

225
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:22,337
each generation of priests
is taught about the flag.

226
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,341
[chuckles]

227
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:26,638
But I'm the only one
who went to the extent

228
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,893
of making a model to confirm it.

229
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,447
If Yoriyuki Marukami,
who knows about it too,

230
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:39,038
wishes to resolve
the gloom in his own heart,

231
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:43,296
or free the townspeople
from the chains binding them…

232
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,217
Or even

233
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:52,481
settle things with the Kasasagis
that may or may not come,

234
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:57,951
the key is likely to be here,
at Mount Marukami.

235
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:01,082
Don't you agree?

236
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:07,762
[Nanmaru] But… why are we building
a bonfire every night?

237
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:10,141
It's a pretty big fire.

238
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,064
To let Yoriyuki know

239
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,445
that there are people
from the village here.

240
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:20,495
[Professor Marukami]
We've actually got quite a few up here.

241
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,499
[Nanmaru] But why?

242
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:28,595
Yoriyuki Marukami's goal…

243
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,350
is probably

244
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:34,273
to eradicate Mount Marukami itself.

245
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,110
What?

246
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:39,116
[Professor Marukami]
That would settle everything.

247
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:44,376
The gloom in his heart, the Kasasagis…

248
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,299
The festival…

249
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:52,476
The history of a village bound in chains
would end there.

250

[♪ pensive music playing]

251
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:59,198
Yoriyuki has taken many lives.

252
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:03,331
However, he would protect
the lives of the villagers,

253
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,838
as he was both a lord and a priest.

254
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,009
In other words,

255
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:11,765
this will stop the mountain

256
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,811
from disappearing.

257
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:20,490
Professor, you're actually kind of scary.

[Nanmaru] You suppose?

265
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:38,777
Also, I know I'm an outsider,

266
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,906
but I am technically of royal bloodline.

267
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,662
Even so, Yoriyuki seemed
more than happy to erase me.

268
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,419
Right, that is a problem.

269
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,841
"A problem"?

270
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:58,734
[Emi] Actually,

271
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,159
we asked the people on duty today
if we could take their place.

272
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,292
We want to help too.

one day…

I want to leave this town

and live somewhere else.

I know you can do it.

You can find a town that suits you,
then rent a room.

Yeah.

Actually,

it's more surprising that Professor Emi
left to be a housewife in the countryside.

She's not a housewife.

No.

He's started
a non-profit organization by himself.

-[chuckles]

So what kind of work is it?

546
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,717
I think he said
he was running "swap markets."

547
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:49,180
[Tagaya] No money is used at all.

548
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:55,067
He's like an event organizer
who holds markets all over the country

549
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,238
where people just swap items.

550
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:59,952
-For this?
-Yeah, let's swap.

551
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:03,124
-Wouldn't that be strange?
-It's not strange at all.

00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,502
-Really?
-Now, now.

553
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:06,047
-What's the problem?
-Well…

554
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,011
I'm giving her a camera,
but she's giving me a stuffed toy.

555
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:10,305
Aren't I losing out?

556
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:12,936
Still though, you want this toy, right?

557
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:14,355
Exactly!

558
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:17,529
You said so first!

559
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:19,992
But the value is completely different!

560
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:22,413
-Value doesn't matter.
-Right!

561
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:24,751
You swap something for what you want.

562
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,172
If you don't want the stuffed toy
enough to swap the camera,

563
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,135
then this deal is off.

564
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:30,470

but…

All right, fine then.

577
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:00,657
This is the opposite concept.

578

Right. He said he wasn't using it at all.

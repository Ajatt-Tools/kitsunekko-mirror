Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.40,0:06:07.85,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,but I suspect these places have also \Nbeen attacked by the same culprit. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.85,0:06:09.05,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,And?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.99,0:07:10.20,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Makes sense to me. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.20,0:07:12.66,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,So then, who is behind it? 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.97,0:07:15.28,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I haven't yet...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.53,0:07:42.75,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Later...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.25,0:07:48.39,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,So, Professor, is that all you wanted to say? 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.39,0:07:49.22,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,No. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.88,0:07:54.70,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Now I get to the good part.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.75,0:08:04.50,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,You lied? 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.50,0:08:05.97,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Some lies are justified. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.97,0:08:07.65,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Look at this. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.15,0:08:09.96,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,It's the map from before, right? 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.96,0:08:13.84,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,If I connect them in the order of attacks... 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.66,0:08:20.30,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,This is like a map of the culprit's movements. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.30,0:08:23.35,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,They are moving from the central \NUS toward the west coast.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.42,0:08:54.06,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,It'd be easiest to ask Mr. Hughes to look into \Nthe places that might be researching the Skrugg.

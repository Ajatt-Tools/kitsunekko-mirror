OTARU - NOBORIBETSU

00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:11,303
<i>Noboribetsu was known as the largest</i>
<i>hot spring region at the time.</i>

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,099
<i>The springs of this region were known</i>
<i>for their healing properties.</i>

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,184
<i>After the First Sino-Japanese War</i>
<i>and Russo-Japanese War,</i>

6
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:21,313
<i>this region was designated</i>
<i>a recuperative facility for 7th division.</i>

FAMOUS NOBORIBETSU HOT SPRING
"THE WATERFALL BATH"

00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,989
-This hits the spot.
-They're switching!

9
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,495
Private First Class Nikaidou
and Superior Private Usami.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,666
Did you arrive today?

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,794
Sergeant Major Kikuta, sir.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,841
How is your injury?

13
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:54,680
I see, Lieutenant Tsurumi
sent you here to check my condition.

14
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,437
He must really be hoping to rely on me
when I can rejoin the fray.

15
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,319
By the way, have you heard
Private Ariko's peculiar story?

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,696
What's that?

17
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:16,827
<i>Last night, while hiking up to a spring</i>
<i>in the mountains, he saw a strange man.</i>

18
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,124
<i>He ran off into the snowy darkness,</i>
<i>with no lantern, wearing wooden sandals</i>.

19
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,001
<i>Isn't that bizarre?</i>

20
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,463
My balls are gonna switch places!

21
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,849
{\an8}EPISODE 39 - THE SMELL OF SULFUR

22
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,977
{\an8}A man who wears wooden sandals
in the snow-covered mountains at night?

23
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,772
There are such things
as snow sandals, though.

24
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:13,360
Perhaps his eyes had adjusted to the dark
by the time he ran off.

25
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:18,365
Nothing about it sounds that peculiar.

26
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,200
Can't you see that I'm busy?

27
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,995
You can ask Ariko yourself.

28
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,497
Right, Private Ariko?

29
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,292
I'm certain I heard sandals clanking,

30
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,629
but the tracks in the snow weren't
sandal tracks.

31
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,881
The tracks were from straw-woven boots.

32
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,509
What do you find so suspicious?

33
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,012
There were other details, Ariko.

34
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,266
I also couldn't help
but notice his clothes.

35
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,685
His garment had the strangest pattern.

36
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,770
Like what?

37
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,564
<i>I couldn't see it that well.</i>

38
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,816
<i>I don't know how to describe it.</i>

39
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,447
You all have been here goofing off
ever since the war ended.

40
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,531
It's made you stupid.

41
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,034
Don't be so rude, Nikaidou.

42
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:10,042
<i>Anyhow, Private Ariko, why did you</i>
<i>go so deep in the mountains?</i>

43
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,504
There's a secret spring
only the Ainu know about.

44
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,882
-Are you Ainu?
-I am.

45
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,510
Perhaps this man you saw is also Ainu.

46
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,180
The strange garment you speak of
sounds like an Ainu pattern.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,015
I'd recognize an Ainu garment.

48
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:29,269
For some reason, I can't stop
thinking about his story.

49
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,230
Am I being paranoid?

50
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,190
Any thoughts, Anma?

51
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,735
An unusual Ainu-patterned garment?

52
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,489
Sorry, but no. If I see anything like it,
I'll let you know.

53
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,741
If you could!

54
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,963
What? Unbelievable! How?

55
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,468
I'm begging you, Nikaidou.

56
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,305
Just tell me.

57
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,602
What do the Abashiri convicts' tattoos
look like?

58
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,355
I've never seen one.

59
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,571
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

60
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,994
Ariko, did anyone else see
this suspicious man?

61
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,662
Go ask the the people in your village.

62
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,747
Roger.

63
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,249
We're lagging behind Usami and his men.

64
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,501
They think they're better than us.

65
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,463
It'd be nice to have
something of value to offer

66
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,965
when we rejoin Lieutenant Tsurumi.

67
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:47,014
Are you going back to Abashiri
with Private Ariko?

68
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,934
No, Lieutenant Tsurumi
will be leaving Abashiri soon.

69
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,394
We'll rendezvous along the way.

70
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,815
Wonder what he plans on doing with
the fortune-teller and cannibal geezer.

71
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,108
Do you think he'll bring them along?

72
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,361
That's none of our concern.

73
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,908
Hey, can you stop being so rough?

74
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,160
Massage me gently.

75
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,120
You've been hurting me this whole time.

76
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,372
You're the worst masseur.

77
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,833
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

78
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,174
The two that came here recently,
they're from Lieutenant Tsurumi's corps.

79
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,717
They're an invaluable source
of information.

80
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,886
We must eliminate Ariko and Kikuta

81
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,348
before they catch on
to our true purpose here.

82
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,601
We should lie in wait
until the next new moon.

83
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,229
The moon lights up the night
more than usual in the winter.

84
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,272
We have no time to waste.

85
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,275
If we can't stay here anymore,

86
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:43,987
we'll no longer be able to relay intel
about the 7th to Hijikata Toshizou.

87
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,158
Toni, Ariko spotted you in the mountains.

88
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,451
This is your fault.

89
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,755
<i>The hot springs in the depths</i>
<i>of the mountains of Noboribetsu</i>

90
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,466
<i>are today called Karurusu Hot Springs.</i>

91
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,970
<i>The Ainu in the region</i>
<i>called this spring </i>Penke-yu.

92
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,685
I wonder if the man in sandals
will show up tonight as well.

93
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:26,864
{\an8}<i>Have you seen a man wearing a garment</i>
<i>with strange patterns near </i>Penke-yu?

94
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,450
{\an8}<i>He appears after sundown.</i>

95
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,748
<i>The clank of sandals.</i>

96
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,711
{\an8}<i>The pattern wasn't on a garment.</i>

97
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,629
{\an8}<i>Those were his tattoos.</i>

98
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,518
<i>He must be the man Ariko saw.</i>

99
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,979
<i>Although he has a lit lantern.</i>

100
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,692
You there! Take off your robe slowly
and show me your skin.

101
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,750
<i>Can he see me?</i>

102
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,337
<i>I lit the lantern so nobody's eyes</i>
<i>would adjust to the darkness!</i>

103
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,884
Tsk, we've got company.

104
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,141
I can see every single one of you.

105
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:43,190
<i>There's a theory that says</i>
<i>that pirates wore eye patches</i>

106
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,361
<i>to allow their eyes to adjust</i>
<i>to the darkness below decks.</i>

107
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,989
<i>Sergeant Major Kikuta had worn</i>

108
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:55,327
<i>an eye patch on his left eye</i>
<i>in anticipation of nighttime combat.</i>

109
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,621
<i>His eyes were completely adjusted</i>
<i>to the dark!</i>

110
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,501
Retreat, dumbasses! You've been spotted!

111
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,837
Damn, this is why I wanted
to wait until the new moon!

112
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,215
This is a problem.

113
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,052
Go, go! Down to the valley!

114
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,139
You're going nowhere.

115
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,617
I can't see a thing.

116
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,706
I'm sick of the smell of sulfur.

117
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:45,210
Once we get our share of the treasure,
let's move to the beach.

118
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,307
Caught him!

119
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,688
He's dead!

120
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,193
That came from the direction
of Jigokudani.

121
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:19,536
You've done it now. How dare you
mess with my precious collection.

122
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,582
<i>During the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Sergeant Major Kikuta</i>

123
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:28,045
<i>was obsessed with stealing guns</i>
<i>from the Russian soldiers he killed.</i>

124
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,466
<i>He especially coveted the</i> Nagant M1895,

125
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,302
<i>so much so that he ordered</i>
<i>his men to search any bodies for it.</i>

126
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,852
Please don't shoot.

127
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,187
It's me.

128
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,689
His allies are closing in!

129
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,613
We're screwed!

130
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,869
He ran towards higher ground.

131
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,330
Sergeant Major Kikuta.

132
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,499
Is that you, Ariko?

133
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,002
What I saw that night were tattoos.

134
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,173
We'll chase them. Follow me.

135
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,229
By the way, Usami, your timing
couldn't have been more perfect.

136
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,483
You and Nikaidou were staking out
by the Ainu springs, weren't you.

137
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,862
You two pieced it together
when you heard Ariko's story.

138
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,989
You were trying to outsmart us.

139
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,826
We've been caught.

140
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,543
Why did the tattooed prisoners
risk themselves

141
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,213
by infiltrating the 7th's hot spring base?

142
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,967
Wait, I know this guy.

143
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,469
He's the masseur.

144
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,154
His tracks lead into this cave.

145
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,116
It's an old tunnel.
I went in here when I was a child.

146
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,534
Any other way out?

147
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,911
There are a couple
if they haven't caved in.

148
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,415
They must be deeper inside.

149
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,584
Do not light matches.

150
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,669
That'll make us easy targets.

151
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,349
<i>I can't see a thing.</i>

152
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,070
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>Something is protruding from the ground.</i>

153
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,158
<i>One careless move,</i>
<i>and they'll know exactly where we are.</i>

154
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,454
<i>Icicles which form on the ground</i>
<i>when water drips from the ceiling</i>

155
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,124
<i>down to the ground</i>
<i>are known as ice stalagmites.</i>

156
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,836
<i>This is a rare phenomenon,</i>
<i>even in the harsh Hokkaido winter.</i>

157
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,047
Shoe's on the other foot, now.

158
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,427
<i>So this prisoner has</i>
<i>an acute sense of hearing.</i>

159
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,642
<i>He takes his aim using the crunching</i>
<i>sound of the icicles.</i>

160
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,147
<i>I didn't even notice these icicles</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

161
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,107
<i>With some rolled-up birch bark,</i>

162
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,026
<i>I'd be able to track him</i>
<i>while evading his shots.</i>

163
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,446
<i>But lighting a huge light here</i>
<i>just makes me a perfect target.</i>

164
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:51,998
Bastard!

165
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,513
<i>He's advancing quickly,</i>
<i>but I hear no cracking ice.</i>

166
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,393
<i>How is he able to move in this darkness</i>
<i>without shattering the icicles?</i>

167
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,480
<i>Even in the volcanic gas of Jigokudani,</i>
<i>they could still fight.</i>

168
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,757
<i>A torch?</i>

169
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,971
If it isn't the masseur.

170
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,266
So you really couldn't see.

171
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,269
He knows now. I'm screwed again!

172
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,146
The masseur.

173
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,024
Our foe can accurately tell
his surroundings through sounds.

174
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,444
There must be come sort of a trick
using the sound of that sandal,

175
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,529
but, whatever.

176
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,911
He got out.

177
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,251
Sergeant Major Kikuta!

178
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,503
I got shot in the leg!

179
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,089
Please don't leave me behind!

180
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,258
It's dark in here!

181
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,886
What a pain in the ass.

182
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,763
I can take care of him by myself.

183
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,015
I have an idea.

184
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,643
Hunting is best done alone and quietly.

185
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,146
All right. Just don't lose him.

186
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,904
I need to reload.

187
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,417
<i>Will Ariko be all right by himself?</i>

188
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,712
Shut up. Like you're one to talk.

189
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,926
Ariko was one of the rescue crew from
the Hakkoda Mountain mission, you know.

190
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,722
<i>The Hakkoda Mountains incident.</i>

191
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,100
<i>Two years before the Russo-Japanese war,</i>

192
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,519
<i>the fifth infantry regiment</i>
<i>stationed in Aomori</i>

193
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,938
<i>was sent on a march in the snow</i>
<i>as part of winter training.</i>

194
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,024
<i>199 soldiers died.</i>

195
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,403
<i>One of the strangest disasters in history.</i>

196
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:31,408
So he's one of the Ainu specifically
recruited from Hokkaido for that mission?

197
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,578
The Ainu search party walked
through the frigid river of ice

198
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,832
and swiftly over deep snow banks
as if it were flat ground.

199
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,292
They retrieved the bodies one by one.

200
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>Even the local skeptics</i>
<i>were left speechless.</i>

201
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,298
<i>Besides that, Noboribetsu is</i>
<i>like his backyard.</i>

202
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,845
<i>No one can outrun Rikimatsu Ariko</i>
<i>in these mountains.</i>

203
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:17,412
That snapping of a branch
sounded a little too intentional.

204
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,188
Where is this sound coming from?

205
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,321
I get it now.

206
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,324
He led me here on purpose.

207
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,577
He knew exactly
where this is likely to occur.

208
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,208
I've lost.

209
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,974
{\an8}FOUR DAYS LATER

210
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,352
Where's Sergeant Major Kikuta?

211
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,354
He went to the mountains
to look for him again.

212
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,106
<i>But he's been gone for four whole days.</i>

213
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,984
<i>Private Ariko has got to be dead.</i>

214
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,279
Did you wire Lieutenant Tsurumi?

215
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:37,200
I did. Lieutenant Tsurumi
will come to Noboribetsu.

216
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,203
Ariko is dead, my leg is injured,

217
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,288
and we let that prisoner escape.

218
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,085
We're gonna get chewed out again!

219
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,635
Ipopte.

220
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,974
Hey, Ariko.

221
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,310
You could've let us know you were okay.
We were worried sick.

222
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,312
I've been anticipating your arrival.

223
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,316
KO - BOU - RO - SATO
KA - KO - YATSU

224
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,860
Why did you skin him?

225
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,070
Explain yourself, Ariko.

226
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,573
While inspecting the tattoos
on the corpse,

227
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,993
I realized that they ended abruptly
along his midsagittal line.

228
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,327
Midsagittal line?

229
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,122
<i>The prisoners' tattoos</i>
<i>are meant to be skinned</i>

230
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,416
<i>in the same manner as a hunted animal.</i>

231
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,667
<i>I understand.</i>

232
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,419
<i>I found him deep in the mountains.</i>

233
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,755
<i>Carrying a corpse down a mountain</i>
<i>is quite cumbersome,</i>

234
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,340
<i>so I skinned him where I found him.</i>

235
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:40,096
I was also afraid that Private Usami
would try to take credit.

236
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:45,602
I decided to hide in the village
until you came looking for me.

237
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,064
And his gun?

238
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:54,277
I thought you'd ask and searched for it,
but it got buried in the avalanche.

239
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,364
The only trophies are his skin and this.

240
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,241
Excellent, Ariko.

241
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,493
All thanks to your impeccable judgment.

242
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,372
We couldn't have fetched
a better gift for Lieutenant Tsurumi.

243
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,628
Now, we can make up for lost time.

244
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,013
What're you making, granny?

245
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,641
If you're cooking up snacks
to go with the drinks, I'd love one.

246
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,645
Rice soaked in water?
What're you gonna do with that?

247
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:44,661
<i>It's unknown whether this is</i>
<i>a traditional Karafuto Ainu dish or not.</i>

248
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,915
<i>However, there are witness accounts</i>
<i>of "grandma's pre-chewed dumplings."</i>

249
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,917
<i>Her grandchildren just said,</i>

250
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,171
<i>"Whatever it was, it was very delicious."</i>

251
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,312
It reminds me of <i>kiritanpo</i> in Akita,

252
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,523
where they take leftover rice,
mash it, and cook it.

253
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:19,404
Hey granny, I want more of your dumplings!

254
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,239
<i>Pirka, pirka.</i>

255
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,743
Granny, can you make more? Please?

256
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,203
<i>Pirka, pirka.</i>

257
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,373
Grandma, I can't wait another minute!

258
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,041
Give it to me straight!

259
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,713
You guys are disgusting.

260
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,344
-Tsukishima.
-Yes?

261
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:48,224
What does "<i>barchonok</i>" mean in Russian?

262
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,476
<i>Barchonok</i>?

263
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,397
It's a word used to mock little boys
from rich families.

264
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,481
In other words,

265
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,859
<i>"silver spoon."</i>

266
00:21:58,943 --> 00:21:59,986

{\an8}NOBORIBETSU

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:06,257
{\an8}Never expected our masseur to be a spy.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,635
This skin belonged to a daring man.

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,556
Ariko wants to tell you something
about the tattoo's pattern.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,268
They look very similar to the tattoos
on my grandmother's hands.

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,645
Maybe they're somehow connected
to Ainu ciphers.

7
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,564
Oh?

8
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,817
{\an8}EN - KOTO - SHOU
RO - KO - KYOU

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,948
Are these all the tattooed skins you have?

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,950
That's right.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,077
Before I forget, Ariko,

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:38,164
I'm surprised you were able
to dig it out of the avalanche.

13
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,541
I happened to get lucky.

14
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,335
I spotted his feet
sticking out of the snow.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,590
Had luck not been on our side,
this one could have already decomposed

16
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,092
or been eaten by wild animals.

17
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:55,890
A single lost tattoo could mean
that the treasures may never be found.

18
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,850
The thought sends shivers down my spine.

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,020
So, Ariko,

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,481
does it look like the Ainu tattoo?

21
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,358
The tattoo patterns vary by region.

22
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,446
I thought it had something to do
with the tattooed skins,

23
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,947
but I have no help to offer.

24
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,868
How unfortunate.
Still, I appreciate your insight.

25
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,291
Ariko, it's the same moon.

26
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,794
What about the moon?

27
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>We found each other in the aftermath</i>
<i>of the Battle of Mukden</i>

28
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,175
<i>and spent the night together.</i>

29
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:35,304
<i>In the pitch-black night, only the moon's</i>
<i>gleaming light was visible.</i>

30
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,265
At least the moon hasn't changed.

31
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,272
THE NEXT NIGHT

32
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,947
Watch your step, Sir Koito.

33
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,449
Tonight is the new moon.

34
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,462
Where did he go?

35
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
This way!

36
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,136
Do you have them?

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,930
Yeah, I grabbed them all!

38
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,857
{\an8}EPISODE 42 - A SWEET LIE

39
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,525
{\an8}I found footprints!

40
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,069
{\an8}Don't let them get away!

41
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,405
There's a tall cliff to the right.

42
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,491
A round rock to the left.

43
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,120
We'll face a dead end
if we keep going this way.

44
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,997
Let's find another way.

45
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,125
Watch out for fallen trees.

46
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,129
You reek of blood. Will you last
until we pass the mountain?

47
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:15,839
Yes.

48
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,593
A FEW HOURS EARLIER

49
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,690
That knife-- Why is it here?

50
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,485
Lieutenant Tsurumi retrieved
the victims' belongings

51
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,404
after the tragedy in Tomakomai.

52
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,740
Nopperabou killed seven Ainu.

53
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:45,285
We know that your old man
was among the murdered men.

54
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,246
What a shame.

55
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,625
You've forgotten about the moon
we saw from the trenches.

56
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:58,007
This tattooed skin you brought
isn't Anji Toni's.

57
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:03,429
Toshizou Hijikata was unaware

58
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,432
that we have a copy of Toni's tattoo.

59
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,184
He convinced you to betray us, didn't he?

60
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,688
Perhaps he said something about
carrying out your father's will.

61
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,199
There's no going back now.

62
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,952
You've chosen to follow a disastrous path.

63
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,833
<i>He's still alive.</i>

64
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,050
Ariko Ipopte.

65
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:49,349
I'll tell you the difference
between me and Toshizou.

66
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,519
For Toshizou's plans to succeed,

67
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,773
he needs the Ainus' trust and cooperation.

68
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:00,861
In other words, even if you betray him,
he can't punish you harshly.

69
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,988
But with me, it's entirely different.

70
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,783
I do not discriminate
between Japanese and Ainu.

71
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,078
I punish them all equally.

72
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,830
Ikaripopo, your mother.

73
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,957
Yayuhuyka, your older brother.

74
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,376
Your sister, Rerasuya,
who married and moved to Hidaka.

75
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,046
Your nephews, Isoninpa and Tumasinu.

76
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,382
Private First Class Ariko.

77
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,178
Take these skins to Toshizou Hijikata.

78
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,138
Infiltrate their forces.

79
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,433
You're a mole,
so it should be easy, right?

80
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,480
Brilliant. Now that that's settled…

81
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,150
It'd be better if you looked like
you had to run for your life.

82
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,486
Usami, do it.

83
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,448
Yes, it's my pleasure.

84
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,284
Brace yourself, Ariko.

85
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,294
Better run, Ariko.

86
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,713
Those pursuers won't know about
our little talk.

87
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,298
Ready, go.

88
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,594
Come on. I just need one short break.

89
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,097
I'm a blind old man, you know!

90
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,182
We need to cover more ground.

91
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,060
We need another day's march without sleep,
or they'll catch up.

92
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,693
Finally.

93
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,653
They got you good.

94
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,031
-I'm wiped.
-They found us stealing the skins.

95
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,449
And the spoils?

96
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,832
We have Sekiya's tattoo,
the one Ariko took as Anji Toni's fake,

97
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,835
and five skins
Lieutenant Tsurumi collected.

98
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,712
Six skins in total.

99
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,589
Is that all?

100
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,258
As far as I know.

101
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,844
Could he have a secret set?

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,431
I heard the lieutenant always wears one
under his clothes.

103
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,560
I stole them while he was bathing.
I'm certain I grabbed all of them.

104
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,814
Our collection…

105
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,943
Yes, we need Ariko to gain trust,
but was it worth parting with the skins?

106
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,446
Why not just the paper copies?

107
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,824
It's important that they're human skins.

108
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,535
Paper copies can be easily faked.

109
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,288
That skin Ariko brought.

110
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,291
It's probably genuine,
though not Anji Toni's.

111
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,919
I have its copy right here.

112
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,797
I copied it down myself,
so I know it's a perfect match.

113
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,467
But to anyone else,

114
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,803
it's nothing but a shady copy.

115
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,890
<i>The skins look authentic</i>
<i>because they're human leather.</i>

116
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:39,561
<i>That's why it was worth fashioning</i>
<i>the fake tattooed skins with Edogai.</i>

117
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,521
Edogai?

118
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:47,152
Ariko left with the fakes
made with genuine human leather.

119
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,656
Fakes? That's incredible.

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,202
<i>Toshizou Hijikata may decipher the code</i>
<i>before we do.</i>

121
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:00,165
<i>When that happens, the fakes will be</i>
<i>a sure obstacle in their path.</i>

122
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,043
Can we trust that Ainu?

123
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,045
Proceed with caution.

124
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,297
I'm sorry to say this,

125
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:12,511
but we expected Lieutenant Tsurumi
to come to the conclusion

126
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,472
that it wasn't Anji Toni's skin.

127
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,435
I watched Saichi Sugimoto
get captured by Lieutenant Tsurumi

128
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,981
after he got shot in Abashiri.

129
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,193
Meaning, Tsurumi acquired a copy
of Anji Toni's skin at that time.

130
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,863
Ariko reached our hideout alive.

131
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,826
He was either sent here as their spy,

132
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,455
or Lieutenant Tsurumi meant
for Ariko to bring those skins.

133
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,669
Either way,
these five skins are most likely fake.

134
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,463
But this is all going according to plan.

135
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,968
<i>These five skins and the one</i>
<i>we found in the taxidermist's house--</i>

136
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,221
<i>It's the same number of skins</i>
<i>as the stuffed humans we saw.</i>

137
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,058
<i>The tattooed skins appear authentic</i>
<i>because they're made of human leather.</i>

138
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:05,147
<i>It would be catastrophic to mix the fakes</i>
<i>with the real ones.</i>

139
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,568
It was right to collect all the fakes
before they spread across Hokkaido.

140
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,989
These skins are flawless but fraudulent.
I'm almost certain of it.

141
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,241
The 7th Division's scheme
to send Ariko among us

142
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:20,579
has left us in a great position.

143
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:26,293
We need to keep close tabs on Asirpa,
our key to the code.

144
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,587
We must depart for Karafuto!

145
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,727
Ryu is chosen as the leader of the pack.

146
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,937
Now he's an <i>isho-seta</i>!

147
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,858
Look at our little Ryu.
The headdress looks good on him!

148
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,861
ENONOKA'S VILLAGE

149
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,366
THE LEAD DOG OF HENKE'S SLEIGH

150
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,329
Smart dogs chosen to lead sleighs
get preferential treatment.

151
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,582
They get to sleep inside the house
with the owner.

152
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,378
Ryu's treated better here
than anywhere else.

153
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,588
He's found his place.

154
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,507
Thanks for everything.

155
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,591
Thanks Ryu.

156
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,844
That sleigh is headed to Odomari.

157
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,846
He'll give us a ride.

158
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,849
This is where we say goodbye
to Henke and Enonoka.

159
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,729
What a responsible little girl.

160
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,274
Enonoka.

161
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,991
We'll wait for you.
Go and say what you need to.

162
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,958
This isn't goodbye.
I'll wait for you to come back.

163
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,336
Hold on to the <i>hohciri</i>
after you cut it off.

164
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,257
Don't forget me.

165
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,718
I won't. I promise.

166
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,720
Time to go! Hop on, everyone!

167
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,725
I'll be back, Enonoka.

168
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,857
Bye, old man! Take care, everyone!

169
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,787
Cikapasi!

170
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,750
Wait for me, Enonoka! I'll promise I'll--

171
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,212
Stop the sleigh. Someone fell off.

172
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,006
Cikapasi, are you hurt?

173
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,591
Hurry up and get over here!

174
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,347
We'll leave you behind!

175
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,230
What's with him?

176
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,233
Hold on for a second.

177
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,122
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>.

178
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,380
Cikapasi, you stay here.

179
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,092
Go and build your own family.

180
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,345
Okay.

181
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,849
<i>Inkarmat doesn't have anyone to rely on,</i>
<i>just like me.</i>

182
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,977
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>,
you have to become her family.

183
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,983
Take this rifle.

184
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,615
The man who saved me gave it to me.

185
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:48,286
Hunt animals with this rifle.
Repay Henke for taking care of you.

186
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,998
But don't use it
until you're a little bigger.

187
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,085
I won't be around to prop you up.

188
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,880
Use it when you're big enough
to stand on your own.

189
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,465
Stand on my own…

190
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,385
You mean erection, Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>.

191
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,889
Right. Erection, Cikapasi.

192
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:12,352
Make sure to take Asirpa back.
You need to make Huci smile!

193
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,105
Don't worry. I will!

194
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,484
Bye, Cikapasi!

195
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,610
Take care!

196
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,124
{\an8}ODOMARI

197
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,002
Lieutenant Tsurumi will arrive tomorrow.

198
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,133
You look distressed.

199
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:48,138
I have something to ask you
before he arrives.

200
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,015
Yes.

201
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,269
<i>In Ako, do you know what Ogata said to me</i>
<i>before his escape?</i>

202
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,646
<i>Barchonok.</i>

203
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,692
He then said…

204
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,281
The next time you see Lieutenant Tsurumi,

205
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,117
ask him about the Manchuria Railway.

206
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,997
<i>The South Manchuria Railway Company.</i>

207
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,834
<i>The rights for the Manchuria Railway</i>
<i>operation after the Russo-Japanese War.</i>

208
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,213
<i>In reality, it's the expansion of Japan's</i>
<i>territory disguised as business.</i>

209
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,633
Within the Imperial Army,

210
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,678
one man strongly opposed the acquisition,
saying it's bound to fail.

211
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,682
<i>It was the former lieutenant general</i>
<i>of the 7th Division, Koujirou Hanazawa.</i>

212
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,102
With Lieutenant General
Hanazawa's suicide,

213
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,188
the Manchurian Railway project
was pushed through.

214
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,817
After he returned from Russo-Japanese war,
Lieutenant Tsurumi said this:

215
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,613
<i>"My comrades still lay beneath</i>
<i>Manchuria's cold ground.</i>

216
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,283
<i>If Manchuria becomes de facto Japan,</i>

217
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,036
then their bones lie under Japanese soil."

218
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:58,208
Did Lieutenant Tsurumi play a part
in Lieutenant General Hanazawa's death?

219
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:03,421
Hyakunosuke Ogata held a grudge
against the central government.

220
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,466
That's why he sided with
Lieutenant Tsurumi's rebellion.

221
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,343
But what if Ogata
learned the truth somehow,

222
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,970
and that's why he betrayed the 7th?

223
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,724
And why did Ogata tell me
about the railway?

224
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,521
He'll say anything to thwart us.

225
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,233
Why do you take him seriously
all of a sudden?

226
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,984
<i>Barchonok</i>.

227
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:30,490
Ogata must have been
one of the conspirators who kidnapped me.

228
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,242
MACHIAI INN

229
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,245
I haven't met Lieutenant Tsurumi yet.

230
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,664
I wonder what he's like.

231
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,874
There's nothing to be worried about.

232
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,836
What will Lieutenant Tsurumi do
if he finds the gold?

233
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,756
If that happens, then at least
no one will come after you.

234
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,175
No. What will happen to my people?

235
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:54,305
They want Hokkaido's independence.
They wouldn't make enemies with the Ainu.

236
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,808
The Ainu would be
a great labor force for them.

237
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,145
We'll make our terms clear
so that we get our way.

238
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,814
No one can solve the code but you.

239
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,817
We have the upper hand.

240
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,325
Ogata? Those masked men were Russian.

241
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,661
You saw their bodies.

242
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:20,623
Were you among the masked men, Tsukishima?

243
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,418
Keep calm, Lieutenant Koito.

244
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,795
You played me and my father!

245
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:30,842
Once my father was indebted to you,
you were free to use his torpedo ships!

246
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,679
Ogata told me about the Manchuria Railway

247
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,975
to show that my father and I are nothing
but pawns in Lieutenant Tsurumi's hands,

248
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,687
just like he and his father were!

249
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,814
That's the truth, isn't it?

250
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,858
That's just crazy speculation.

251
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,110
I'm through with you. I'll ask him myself!

252
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,614
I'll lay the truth down to my father!

253
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,409
But weren't you saved at the end?

254
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,411
What?

255
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:03,166
So Ogata sniffed out
The Manchurian Railways and Hanazawa.

256
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,254
Here I thought he was going to offer up
Lieutenant Tsurumi to the government.

257
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,089
What more does he want?

258
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,802
Wasn't he satisfied with
taking his own father's life?

259
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,888
Ogata killed his father?

260
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,182
I'm also one of his victims.

261
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,351
My story was quite elaborate.

262
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,814
<i>That man was probably actually from Sado.</i>

263
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,817
But I realized that after the war.

264
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:34,322
<i>A soldier in the 2nd in Niigata would not</i>
<i>end up in that makeshift hospital.</i>

265
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,783
<i>The 2nd Division was stationed</i>

266
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,870
<i>in a mountainous region</i>
<i>60 kilometers away from us.</i>

267
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,541
The lieutenant even told me the truth
after nine long years.

268
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,838
He makes sure you wilt first,
then pours on his affection.

269
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,676
<i>He told me all the efforts</i>
<i>that went into saving me.</i>

270
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,095
<i>He built an obedient army</i>
<i>who would toss their lives aside</i>

271
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,056
and gladly do his dirty work.

272
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,268
But it doesn't matter now.

273
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,687
My life has never meant much.

274
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,731
I won't get upset
over someone taking advantage of me.

275
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,528
<i>With the gold at his disposal,</i>
<i>he will use Hokkaido's natural resources</i>

276
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,530
<i>and build a military-based economy.</i>

277
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,575
<i>Next, he will overthrow the government</i>
<i>and establish his military regime.</i>

278
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,743
<i>The 7th rises to power.</i>

279
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:26,791
<i>Ultimately, Manchuria,</i>
<i>our comrades' graveyard, will be annexed.</i>

280
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,335
<i>Isn't that amusing?</i>

281
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,924
Is that Lieutenant Tsurumi's
ultimate goal?

282
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,927
I don't know his true intentions.

283
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,431
He's a natural when it comes to
telling sweet lies and saving others.

284
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:46,394
But if Lieutenant Tsurumi
needs to annex Manchuria

285
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,772
and overthrow the government
to achieve his goal,

286
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,234
not to mention compensating his followers,

287
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,321
there's nothing I can do.

288
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,449
Tsukishima, why are you with him?

289
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:05,413
It's people like him
who leave their name in history.

290
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,292
I'll watch Lieutenant Tsurumi's show
from the front seats

291
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,418
until the curtain call.

292
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,923
You might not want to tell anyone
about what I've told you today.

293
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,135
If things come down to it,
he won't hesitate to kill you.

294
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:24,307
And I will be the one doing his bidding.

295
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,235
Lieutenant Tsurumi--
He's absolutely brilliant!

296
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:41,199
Does this mean he staged
our first encounter in Kagoshima?

297
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,909
He even set up a kidnapping heist!

298
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,162
All the effort,
just to have me in his corner!

299
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,748
Oh, I can't wait!

300
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,833
I want to see Lieutenant Tsurumi!

301
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,671
I wanna see him right this minute!

302
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,552
Oh? Didn't get any sleep?

303
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,097
Hello, Sugimoto the Immortal.

304
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,392
You're gonna hand Asirpa over
to the soldiers

305
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,978
and wag your tail
at Lieutenant Tsurumi, right?

306
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,605
It's not like that.

307
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:17,276
Should've joined him in Otaru
if you were gonna turn to him anyway.

308
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,489
He used to be a lone wolf
who didn't bend to anyone.

309
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,074
Oh, you're a softy now.

310
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,493
Things have changed!

311
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,248
Lieutenant Tsurumi won't bother Asirpa
once the gold is theirs!

312
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,544
Unlike Toshizou Hijikata's plan,
Ainu won't have to fight!

313
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,548
This is what's best for Asirpa!

314
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,009
Asirpa! Asirpa!

315
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:45,054
Weren't you gonna give money
to that one widow you liked?

316
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,640
We settled on a price.

317
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,059
It's enough to cover her treatment.

318
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,104
And what's my cut?

319
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:58,276
I'm hoping to get more than
a couple of coins, you know!

320
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,945
You stingy rat!

321
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,828
So, what? You're gonna show Asirpa
the right path to follow?

322
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,539
She's not your girlfriend,
wife or daughter.

323
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,127
I hate controlling men.

324
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,254
Shut up and scram!

325
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,760
{\an8}You want to believe
that you have something to protect.

326
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,221
{\an8}You're washed up
and too scared to take risks!

327
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,726
{\an8}You didn't see
how Karafuto changed Asirpa.

328
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,396
She saw new things and matured.

329
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,691
She's not the same girl you met in Otaru.

330
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:43,738
{\an8}You found her, but you're not
on the same page as her.

331
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,617
{\an8}Kiroranke didn't lie to her.

332
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,244
{\an8}He brought her all this way to Karafuto

333
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:54,123
{\an8}because he wanted Asirpa to know
what's happening to the Ainu!

334
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,292
{\an8}All things considered,

335
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,755
{\an8}if Asirpa wants to make the fate
of every Ainu her problem, just let her!

336
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,425
Put your trust in her as your equal,

337
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,470
and you'll be unstoppable, like before!

338
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,723
And don't tell me you actually think

339
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:14,185
that Tsurumi cares about the Ainu.

340
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,520
What do you mean?

341

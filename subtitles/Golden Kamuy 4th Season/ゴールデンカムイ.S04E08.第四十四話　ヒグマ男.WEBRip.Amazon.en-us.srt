1
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,773
Stop, you beast!

2
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:20,432
{\an8}EPISODE 44 - BROWN BEAR MAN

3
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,982
This Ainu <i>chise</i> is such a fresh breath
of "Hokkaido," ain't it?

4
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,275
Yeah.

5
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,735
We finally made it back to Hokkaido.

6
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,910
So what now?

7
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,831
Got a plan to search for the gold
with just us?

8
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:50,421
Will we have to steal the tattooed skins
from Hijikata and Tsurumi?

9
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,174
We'll pit them against each other,
then nab the skins!

10
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,719
The "fisherman's profit," yeah?

11
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,056
That's easier said than done.

12
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,017
Hey, <i>nispa.</i>

13
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,729
Got any ideas on a quick way
to make some cash for travel expenses?

14
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,149
There's a <i>kotan</i> villager to the south

15
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,610
who needs a <i>wenkamuy</i> taken care of.

16
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,488
-A <i>wenkamuy</i>? You mean a man-eating bear?
-Yes.

17
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>It's been killing off people</i>
<i>prospecting for gold in the river.</i>

18
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,579
Gold?

19
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,541
Everyone's afraid of the <i>wenkamuy</i>,
so nobody goes near the river.

20
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,336
A river with gold deposits?

21
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,463
I didn't think there were any left.

22
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,589
HERE - URYU RIVER - ABASHIRI

23
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,551
<i>Rumor has it</i>
<i>there's a prospector in the Uryu River.</i>

24
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,803
<i>They say he's making a fortune.</i>

25
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,892
You could look for gold
while the <i>wenkamuy</i> is not looking.

26
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,938
I hear he made
something like 50 yen per day once.

27
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,315
<i>50 yen?</i>

28
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,297
Help me!

29
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:21,011
Help me! Father! Taka! Jirou!

30
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,596
Quickly!

31
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,056
I'm falling!

32
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,516
I can't hold on…

33
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,226
Somebody!

34
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,521
We made it.

35
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,529
Thank you very much.

36
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,864
You saved me.

37
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,325
You're injured. Are you okay?

38
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,495
Oh, that's from something earlier…

39
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,665
<i>Such a nice man.</i>

40
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,084
Heita, thank goodness you're all right.

41
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,128
Taka.

42
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,505
Are you the gold prospector?

43
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,009
Yes. How did you know?

44
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,595
We've come to search for gold as well.

45
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,265
We heard there was gold in the Uryu River.

46
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,396
Oh, is that so?

47
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,691
There's plenty to be found
if you know where to look.

48
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,239
Oh, my. What an odd group of people.

49
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,491
How fun!

50
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,994
How do you know each other?

51
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,913
Oh, and a foreigner as well.

52
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,000
You could say we're… friends?

53
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,877
No, we're just rabble.

54
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,296
Noriko! Go back inside.

55
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,719
We look for cracks in the river bedrock
with this glass box.

56
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,806
That's why we call it "glass-box sniping."

57
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,728
You scrape the gold out of the crack
with a scraper.

58
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,647
It's a good way to get the big ones.

59
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:00,235
Looks like you've come prepared
with the panning method.

60
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,822
It's not easy to find a good location
with the panning method.

61
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,491
I knew it.

62
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,660
I couldn't find anything
the last time I tried.

63
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,580
Could you give us a hint
as to where to pan?

64
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,664
Please?

65
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,708
Well,

66
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,670
you could try beneath that large boulder.

67
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,846
No more!

68
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,724
Asirpa-<i>chan</i>! I need hot water!

69
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,855
Heaven!

70
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,732
At this time of year,

71
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:41,819
you can only search for gold
for four hours around midday.

72
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,240
And panning for gold
is the least effective way to do it.

73
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,618
Are you serious?
We're not going to get anywhere!

74
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:55,207
Was the man who made 50 yen a day
in Uryu River just a load of bull?

75
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,002
No, it's true.

76
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,713
That's how much I made.

77
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,798
What?

78
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,092
Oi, Heita! Watch your mouth!

79
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,762
You saved my life,
so I'll let you in on it.

80
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,306
Do you know what <i>haku</i> is?

81
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,392
What's <i>haku</i>?

82
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,560
I'll show you.

83
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,979
It's this.

84
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:21,525
Prospectors call the gold they dig up <i>aka</i>.

85
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,988
The white stuff mixed in with the <i>aka</i>
is called <i>haku</i>.

86
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,991
This is actually placer platinum.

87
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,161
<i>It's very hard.</i>

88
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,581
<i>It's also resistant to heat,</i>
<i>and acid won't melt it.</i>

89
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,251
<i>Nobody likes it because</i>
<i>it damages goldsmithing tools.</i>

90
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,753
<i>You don't get as much money</i>
<i>with haku mixed in.</i>

91
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,674
You have to take the time to chip it away.

92
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,509
It takes a really long time.

93
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,305
Hokkaido is the only place that has <i>haku</i>,

94
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,058
and Uryu River in particular
has a lot of it.

95
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,476
That's no good.

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,020
But…

97
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,607
there are people out there
who will pay a lot of money for it!

98
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,775
Up to three yen per unit!

99
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,068
What?

100
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,197
That's as much as a gold nugget!

101
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,284
<i>The munitions factories have nothing to do</i>
<i>since the end of the Russo-Japanese War,</i>

102
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,079
<i>so some of them have started producing</i>
<i>domestic fountain pens.</i>

103
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Imported fountain pens</i>

104
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,212
<i>have a hard,</i>
<i>non-abrasive metal on the tip.</i>

105
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,215
<i>They found that the tip</i>
<i>is made from platinum.</i>

106
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:31,511
Then they realized placer platinum
can be found here in Hokkaido.

107
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,224
Everyone thought <i>haku</i> was useless,
but demand has gone through the roof!

108
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,644
There's even increasing
international demand!

109
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,189
Everyone used to just
throw their <i>haku</i> away.

110
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,608
They threw it all away
in Hokkaido's rivers!

111
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,945
This is the second gold rush!

112
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,206
It's him! It's the bear.

113
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,833
-What?
-Where? Where is it?

114
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,585
Over there!

115
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,337
It's watching us.

116
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,423
It hid itself.

117
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,094
It's getting closer.

118
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,222
And it was so far away yesterday.

119
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,141
It's the <i>wenkamuy</i>.

120
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,190
What do you think, Asirpa?

121
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,401
Can you see its tracks?

122
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,236
No, I can't.

123
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,405
Did it get away
by jumping from tree to tree?

124
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,490
I wonder.

125
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,579
Is that the <i>chakchak kamuy</i>?

126
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,375
If there were a bear nearby,
the <i>chakchaks</i> would be chirping

127
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,794
to let us know where it is.

128
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,213
They're quiet.

129
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,010
Here! This is the place…

130
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,138
that should have lots
of platinum deposits.

131
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,891
We should be able to get at least
ten units with a day's work.

132
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,521
We'll split the spoils evenly.

133
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,774
That's more than 15 yen in a day!

134
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,320
That's worth way more
than hunting brown bears.

135
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,824
That's exactly why people stopped hunting
and sullied the rivers by prospecting.

136
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,994
Master Heita, we are in your hands.

137
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,543
That tobacco pouch is Ainu, isn't it?

138
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,504
Oh, this?

139
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:34,468
I used to go prospecting
with some Ainu people.

140
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,511
One of them gave it to me as a gift.

141
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,223
I see. Is that why you know
what a <i>wenkamuy</i> is?

142
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,811
They told me about the <i>wenkamuy</i>
when I was a kid.

143
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,733
I was too afraid even to sleep!

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,153
I was so, so, so scared.

145
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,155
I wet the bed every night.

146
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,324
Poor little Heita.

147
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,578
I was so, so, so, so scared…

148
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,456
We've heard of the <i>wenkamuy</i> as well.

149
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,126
We heard that it's been attacking
gold prospectors in the Uryu River.

150
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,087
Never fear!

151
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,715
We come with a specially trained
brown bear hunter,

152
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,635
so you can focus
entirely on prospecting for gold!

153
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,054
You said it was getting closer?

154
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,100
How long has it been loitering around for?

155
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,102
For years.

156
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,900
Are you drawing?

157
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,860
Having fun?

158
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,489
Say, could you draw me as well?

159
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,492
Draw… me?

160
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,495
Come this way.

161
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,498
It's cold. You should come inside.

162
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,708
Come in.

163
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,759
Do it good.

164
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,015
Do you like my body?

165
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,398
There it is again!

166
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,567
I thought I threw that away!

167
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,528
Noriko! What are you doing?

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,823
But it's so boring out here.

169
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,368
That doesn't mean you can act like this!
You've only just met the man!

170
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,288
I'm not interested in him.

171
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,332
All I wanted was to have
my beauty endure on paper.

172
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,795
All I ever do is wait for you
to find gold.

173
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,339
I'll become an old woman soon enough…

174
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,341
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,760
It's okay. It won't be much longer now.

176
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,682
Once I've found enough <i>haku</i>,

177
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,934
we'll settle down in Tokyo
with a business.

178
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,065
Hey, where's Master Heita?

179
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,193
Did he go off on his own?

180
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,446
That's not a good idea
with a man-eating bear on the loose.

181
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,366
Asirpa! Master Heita's missing!

182
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,993
Can you go look for him?

183
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,915
If the bear gets him,
we'll lose out on the gold!

184
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,501
That's if there really is a bear.

185
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,673
Hey, you.

186
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,763
This way. Come here.

187
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,598
Can you see it?

188
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,267
Over there on the fungus,

189
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,770
aren't they your binoculars?

190
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,773
Maybe Noriko's trying
to play a prank on you.

191
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,578
An <i>amappo</i>. That was close.

192
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:54,084
You can tell where an <i>amappo </i>is used
by signs such as scraped tree trunks.

193
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,336
You should learn the signs, Zukin-<i>chan</i>.

194
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,798
I wonder if someone set it up
to catch deer.

195
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,301
Brown bears are usually hibernating
in their dens by now.

196
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,514
<i>I've searched beyond</i>
<i>where Heita says he saw the bear,</i>

197
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,476
<i>but I couldn't find a single trace</i>
<i>of a </i>matakarip <i>not in its den.</i>

198
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,523
Why is Heita lying about a bear?

199
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,568
Hey, Sugimoto, what's that?

200
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,864
Asirpa! The bear's here!

201
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,908
We saw it!

202
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,828
Master Heita was right. It's close by!

203
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,789
<i>We have to protect Master Heita</i>
<i>from the </i>wenkamuy<i>!</i>

204
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,800
That's weird.

205
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,803
It was definitely around here.

206
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,513
Stop walking around!

207
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,807
I won't be able to tell your steps
from the bear's!

208
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,520
There's no way a bear could be here
without leaving any tracks.

209
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,105
Right.

210
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,233
I'll kill the bear, so Shiraishi,
you go find Master Heita.

211
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,152
Take Zukin-<i>chan</i> with you.

212
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,236
Got it.

213
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,994
Father, Jirou…

214
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,413
<i>Namu Amida Butsu…</i>

215
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,167
A prayer?

216
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,838
<i>Namu Amida Butsu…</i>

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,564
-Are you okay?
-Heita!

218
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,651
Taka… Taka is…

219
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,155
Stop it!

220
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,365
I'm sorry!

221
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,202
Please don't tell Taka!
He'll hit me again…

222
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,126
This is Noriko's fault!

223
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,926
Master Heita!
What's wrong? Did you see the bear?

224
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,427
I have to get out of here!

225
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,389
I have to run, or I'm next!

226
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,725
It's okay. You're with us now.
We'll protect you.

227
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,686
Where did the bear go?

228
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,020
You can't protect me!

229
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,273
It's going to get me.

230
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,526
You have to get as far away from me
as you can!

231
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,194
What do you mean?

232
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:30,782
Father, Jirou, Taka-- It got them all.

233
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,785
Zukin-<i>chan</i>, can you come over here?

234
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,333
It even got Noriko…

235
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,502
It's all my fault.

236
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,422
I led the <i>wenkamuy</i> to them.

237
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,174
Master Heita,

238
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,052
who are you talking about?

239
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,936
<i>Noriko! Go back inside.</i>

240
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,940
<i>Oh, my. What an odd group of people.</i>

241
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,693
<i>Do you like my body?</i>

242
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,823
That there by your feet, Heita.

243
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,159
It's a bear pelt, isn't it?

244
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,413
When did that get here?

245
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,749
When did it get here?

246
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,418
You've been holding on to it
with great care all this time.

247
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,588
No! I threw it away so many times!

248
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:31,176
I've burned it, thrown it in the river,
so why does it keep coming back to me?

249
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>The bear that Sugimoto and Shiraishi saw--</i>

250
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,473
<i>Could it have been this bear pelt?</i>

251
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,810
Quickly! Everyone run!

252
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,062
I think Heita's <i>wenkamuy</i>…

253
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,483
<i>lives inside his head.</i>

254
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,490
Master Heita! What's wrong?

255
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,255
<i>Heita Matsuda, convicted prisoner</i>
<i>on death row at Abashiri Prison.</i>

256
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,260
Oh, yeah. That guy. I remember him well.

257
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,765
He had this weird habit
of changing the way he speaks.

258
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,560
<i>Sometimes he'd start acting like</i>
<i>he thought he was some hot babe.</i>

259
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,229
<i>Man, he was creepy!</i>

260
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:29,025
<i>He shared something with me this one time.</i>

261
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,404
<i>He said, "I've got a bunch</i>
<i>of different people inside of me."</i>

262
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,281
<i>And he would harp on</i>

263
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,577
<i>about being terrified of a bear</i>
<i>roaming around outside the cells.</i>

264
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,663
It's there. It's right outside.

265
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,916
A something-<i>kamuy</i>, he called it.

266
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,293
Some kind of evil, man-eating god.

267
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,795
<i>Wenkamuy.</i>

268
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,298
Yeah, a <i>wenkamuy</i>.

269
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:57,929
He said it attacked and ate
the people in his head one by one.

270
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,892
It saves me for last.
Then it takes over my body.

271
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,145
Then I attack someone else.

272
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,940
I have to kill, or else it won't stop.

273
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,943
<i>Then once I've killed them,</i>

274
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:16,239
<i>my body explodes into chunks of flesh,</i>
<i>and they fly off into the mountains.</i>

275
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,992
And then I go back to normal.

276
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,454
That's how it goes. Over and over again.

277
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:29,252
Where I'm from, when we kill a <i>wenkamuy</i>,
we don't take its meat or its pelt.

278
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,713
We chop it up
and scatter it in the mountains.

279
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,007
That must be what he's talking about.

280
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,885
The <i>wenkamuy</i> controls me.

281
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,305
It conspires to make me break out of here.

282
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,557
Look at this!

283
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,519
I've got tattoos on my body
all of a sudden!

284
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,233
We all thought he was just making it up.

285
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,614
<i>The records from the trial</i>
<i>where Heita Matsuda was sentenced to death</i>

286
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,116
<i>say that he wore a bear pelt</i>

287
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,995
<i>and tore apart his victims' bodies</i>
<i>to get to the flesh…</i>

288
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,624
<i>Heita Matsuda, the Brown Bear Man.</i>

289
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,584
<i>If what he says is true,</i>

290
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,004
<i>he's probably out there somewhere</i>
<i>doing it all over again.</i>

291
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,013
Sugimoto!

292
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,394
<i>This guy's Herculean!</i>

293
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,000
Good. The <i>wenkamuy</i> is growing weak.

294
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,504
Now I can…

295
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,641
Sugimoto! Are you all right?

296
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,267
I did it.

297
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,395
I got him.

298
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,148
This is the same place.

299
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:19,153
I lured him here
so that he wouldn't notice.

300
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,322
We gotta get that arrow out!

301
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,907
Can you do anything, Asirpa?

302
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,160
It's all right. Leave me be.

303
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,539
I've been afraid of the <i>wenkamuy</i>

304
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,917
ever since that Ainu told me as a child.

305
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,503
It's haunted me ever since.

306
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,716
I poured my blood, sweat, and tears
into prospecting for gold,

307
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,594
but my family squandered the money
in a single day.

308
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,639
They were blinded by greed and gold.

309
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,434
I wanted them to be punished.

310
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,438
<i>One day, I found the leftovers</i>
<i>from a bear's kill.</i>

311
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,776
<i>I took it home and hid it</i>
<i>where everyone was sleeping.</i>

312
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,698
<i>An Ainu hunter killed the bear</i>
<i>that killed my family before it ate me</i>

313
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,535
<i>and scattered its remains</i>
<i>around the mountain.</i>

314
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:13,624
The <i>wenkamuy</i> kept coming back after that

315
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,587
as a punishment for my family.

316
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,508
Then it punished me for being too greedy.

317
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:28,848
I fell to the <i>wenkamuy</i>
and attacked innocent people.

318
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,185
I wanted somebody to stop me.

319
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,563
You fought against me, Sugimoto,

320
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,859
so the <i>wenkamuy </i>inside me
can finally disappear.

321
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:52,747
Where I'm from,
when someone is killed by a <i>wenkamuy</i>,

322
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,167
we say the <i>kamuy</i> took them from us
because they liked them.

323
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:01,422
{\an8}We don't believe <i>wenkamuy </i>kill to punish.

324
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,802
He must have only heard
part of the Ainu story.

325
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,431
And so a distorted
<i>wenkamuy</i> grew inside his head.

326
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,309
It's so important
to pass our stories on properly.

327
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,188
Was it his lust for gold
that sent him hurtling over the edge?

328
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,651
<i>Does gold even have that power?</i>

329
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,571
Don't die, Master Heita!

330
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,324
You gotta tell us where to pan next!

331
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,953
Master Heita!

332
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,127

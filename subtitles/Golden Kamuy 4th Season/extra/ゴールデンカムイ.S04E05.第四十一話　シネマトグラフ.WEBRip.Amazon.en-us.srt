1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,379
The telegram said

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:08,217
Lieutenant Tsurumi will leave for Karafuto
after wrapping up business in Noboribetsu.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,385
{\an8}TOYOHARA - ODOMARI

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,263
He'll meet us in Odomari in two weeks.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,348
He wants us to wait around for now.

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,601
We'll stay in Toyohara until then.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,272
You see, Toyohara is a bigger city.

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,858
So we'll find better accommodation there.

9
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,943
That's it for now. You're free to go.

10
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,407
Sugimoto.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,287
Asirpa spoke to Kiroranke before he died.

12
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,582
He had a peaceful look on his face

13
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,793
and said, "I leave the rest to you."

14
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,798
Asirpa could have realized
how to find the gold.

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,969
<i>Maybe Ogata tried to kill her</i>
<i>because he figured it out</i>

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,472
<i>and realized she was no use to him alive.</i>

17
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,848
She wouldn't.

18
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,436
I'll talk to her. Don't get in my way.

19
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:06,150
I don't think Asirpa's ever met
Lieutenant Tsurumi,

20
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:12,281
<i>but she'd never trust a man like that.</i>

21
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,212
{\an8}EPISODE 41 - CINEMATOGRAPH

22
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,514
{\an8}Where are you from?

23
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,766
{\an8}Who is that man?

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,147
{\an8}We're from south of the sea.

25
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,025
{\an8}He's my uncle.

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,526
{\an8}He's got big balls.

27
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,954
Their <i>kotan</i> is close by,
so they wanted to know who we are.

28
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,624
Thanks to you,

29
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,251
the people in Karafuto have been friendly.

30
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,504
But everyone in Karafuto
knows about my huge balls,

31
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,883
because you always use that line
to introduce me.

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,221
<i>I'm glad I didn't get rid of you</i>
<i>back then.</i>

33
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:45,559
We pulled off pretending to be family
in Hokkaido too.

34
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,520
I wonder if Inkarmat is all better now.

35
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:52,775
The telegram said she's recovered enough
to walk and talk.

36
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,444
Really? That's great news!

37
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,739
Yeah. Let's go see her
as soon as we return to Hokkaido.

38
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,450
Cikapasi.

39
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,995
Are you leaving?

40
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,383
-Hey, Sugimoto. Come look at this.
-Is it poop?

41
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,261
It's a wolverine footprint.
The kind you told me about, right?

42
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,638
Oh, that.

43
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,642
They're faster
and more ferocious than bears.

44
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,894
I didn't get to see one.

45
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,939
Hey, let's catch a wolverine.

46
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,318
We came all this way. I know you want
to taste its brains before we leave.

47
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,821
All brains taste the same!

48
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,242
Let's light a fire and offer a prayer
before we enter the woods.

49
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,752
You may be a modern Ainu woman,
but you never miss a chance for a ritual.

50
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,717
Many dangers lurk in the mountains.

51
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,220
These rituals help us stay vigilant.

52
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,889
Now that we have matches,

53
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,144
we only use tools like this
when we're hunting.

54
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,147
I want to preserve the tradition.

55
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,371
{\an8}Go back to Russia.

56
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,749
An Ainu child.

57
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,419
That was intriguing.

58
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,547
Can you show us from the beginning?

59
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,716
And who are you?

60
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,177
We're filming moving pictures.

61
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,429
What is that?

62
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,142
There it is!

63
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,145
What the hell is it?

64
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,814
Shake it off.
I'll kill it with my poison arrow!

65
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,484
I'll chuck it!

66
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,280
Asirpa, behind you!

67
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,046
Marvelous. Did you catch that?

68
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,757
Stay back! Its fur is standing on end!

69
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,354
We finally got to taste wolverine brains.

70
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,855
<i>Hinna hinna</i>, huh?

71
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,400
Nope. They all taste the same.

72
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,488
So, what were you filming here again?

73
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,492
We were filming Karafuto Ainu hunts,

74
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,453
but we got separated from the hunters.

75
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,206
Is it different from photographs?

76
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,794
This is a filming device
known as a cinematograph.

77
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,297
This device can capture many things,
like the flow of time

78
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,969
or the movement of people
by taking pictures in rapid succession.

79
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:12,975
We've used this cinematograph
to document much of the Ainu culture.

80
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,309
INN

81
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:18,063
Lumiére, the company
that invented the cinematograph,

82
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,358
sent technicians
to every corner of the world.

83
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,987
Japan is one of
the most popular locations to film.

84
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,740
He's Girel, a Lumiére technician.

85
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,618
And I'm Katsutarou Inaba.

86
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,372
I was granted the exclusive rights
by Lumiére to exhibit the films in Japan.

87
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,749
I'm a moving-picture producer.

88
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,878
So how do you watch moving pictures?

89
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,845
Wow! They move!
The people in the picture are dancing!

90
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,435
We came to Karafuto
because we heard about the Ainu here.

91
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:01,315
Hokkaido Ainu films
were well received at Lumiére.

92
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:02,983
Right?

93
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,695
Do you have more films of Ainu dances?

94
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,365
What about storytelling?

95
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,118
We didn't film any storytelling.

96
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,330
This apparatus can't capture voices.

97
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,709
You can't preserve the voice
with an image.

98
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,548
Let's act out Ainu stories in a play
and preserve them in moving pictures!

99
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,135
You mean, you want us to put on a play
and record it?

100
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,889
Well, we filmed Kabuki performances.

101
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,726
But Ainu stories are told orally.

102
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,770
Won't voice recording do?

103
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,857
Besides,
plays aren't a part of your culture.

104
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,818
But motions would help people
understand the story better.

105
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:52,324
Film is a great way to share our stories
with people who don't speak our language!

106
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,954
I'm a producer, you know.

107
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,583
I don't have time to waste
on an idea that might go bust.

108
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,544
I swear it'll be great!

109
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,922
Just do as she says.

110
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,009
If it weren't for Asirpa, you'd be stuffed
in the wolverine's guts right now.

111
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,053
Or are you that ungrateful?

112
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,058
The first one will be
<i>Stories of Panampe and Penampe.</i>

113
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,647
<i>Panampe</i> means "people from downstream,"
and <i>penampe</i> means "people from upstream."

114
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,316
There are lots of stories
about these two guys.

115
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,653
In every story, the <i>panampe</i>
somehow ends up wealthy.

116
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,406
The <i>penampe</i> gets jealous
and copies the <i>panampe</i>,

117
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,200
but because he's greedy, things end badly.

118
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,744
Kind of like the flies and the honey pot.

119
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,747
Starring Saichi Sugimoto as the <i>panampe</i>

120
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,958
and Yoshitake Shiraishi as the <i>penampe</i>!

121
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,042
DIRECTED BY ASIRPA

122
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,585
The script for her story.

123
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,922
Moving pictures, shoot!

124
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,425
Now roll!

125
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,557
<i>One day, the </i>panampe<i> drilled a hole</i>
<i>in an icy river and soaked his wiener.</i>

126
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,642
This story is already weird!

127
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,230
<i>Fish gathered at his wiener.</i>

128
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,899
<i>He went home with a basket full of fish.</i>

129
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,860
<i>His wife was delighted.</i>

130
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,404
Cut. Stop the reel!

131
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,908
You just got loads of food in the winter,
when resources are scarce.

132
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,704
Are those the faces you would pull?

133
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:25,042
We're telling a story through images.
You need to be more expressive!

134
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,044
You're replaceable, you know that?

135
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,046
We're awfully sorry.

136
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,508
<i>The</i> panampe <i>was enjoying a cozy life</i>
<i>when the</i> penampe <i>came by.</i>

137
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,428
<i>He asked the</i> panampe
<i>how he stumbled upon such a good life.</i>

138
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>Just like the </i>panampe<i> did, the </i>penampe
<i>stuck his wiener in the icy river.</i>

139
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,686
<i>But the greedy man</i>
<i>stayed there the entire night.</i>

140
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,899
<i>The </i>penampe<i>'s wiener froze overnight,</i>
<i>and he was completely stuck.</i>

141
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,943
<i>His wife tried to smash the ice</i>
<i>with a hatchet…</i>

142
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,323
<i>but she cut off his wiener instead.</i>

143
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,369
<i>And so the </i>penampe<i> died in a dumb way.</i>

144
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,579
What a horrible story!

145
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,332
I don't like that house in my shot.

146
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,250
Ask its owner if we can tear it down.

147
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,627
That's ridiculous!

148
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,838
Do we even have time for this?

149
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,507
It's taking ages.

150
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,259
I told you to stay out of my way.

151
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,807
Tsukishima,
I heard you being sneaky to Sugimoto.

152
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,643
You want to play a woman
to get more screen time.

153
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,562
<i>The Stories of Panampe and Penampe</i>,
part two.

154
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,107
Get ready… Start!

155
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,611
<i>One day, the </i>panampe<i> was stretching out</i>
<i>his wiener by the shore.</i>

156
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,987
This is already weird!

157
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,616
<i>His wiener reached Matsumae.</i>

158
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,618
Hey, Russian, get out of the shot!

159
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,416
<i>The Matsumae retainers' wives</i>
<i>thought they'd found a sturdy hanging rod.</i>

160
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,876
<i>They hung the finest kimonos</i>
<i>on the </i>panampe<i>'s wiener.</i>

161
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,006
<i>When the </i>panampe<i> drew his wiener back in,</i>
<i>all the kimonos came too.</i>

162
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,344
<i>Then the </i>penampe<i> came to see the </i>panampe<i>,</i>
<i>who was now rich.</i>

163
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,514
<i>The </i>penampe<i> heard</i>
<i>from the </i>panampe<i> what he did.</i>

164
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,893
<i>The </i>penampe<i> stretched out his wiener</i>
<i>by the sea just the same.</i>

165
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,064
<i>Like before, the retainers' wives came.</i>

166
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,525
<i>But they knew</i>
<i>the rod had taken their kimonos.</i>

167
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,445
<i>They drew their katanas</i>
<i>and chopped it off.</i>

168
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,740
<i>The </i>penampe<i> died in a dumb way.</i>

169
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,285
Wait. Do I die at the end of every story?

170
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,539
This won't do.
These plays aren't good enough!

171
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,585
What's wrong? You don't look well.

172
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,714
They won't withstand the test of time!

173
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,718
What if we film a serious story,
not ones about wieners?

174
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,971
That's smart, Sugimoto.

175
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:48,226
Most stories about the <i>panampe</i>
and the <i>penampe</i> are crude.

176
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,438
Next, we'll film <i>The Life of Kesorap</i>.

177
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,357
This story is about three brothers.

178
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,901
Cikapasi, you're the star!

179
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,819
Nice, Cikapasi!

180
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,322
Ready, roll!

181
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,659
<i>I have an older brother</i>
<i>and a little brother.</i>

182
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,703
<i>We always hunt together.</i>

183
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,582
<i>One day while out on a hunt,</i>
<i>we traveled far and found a house.</i>

184
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,835
<i>Three sisters lived there.</i>

185
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,215
<i>So we cooked our catch and told </i>yukars<i>.</i>

186
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,093
<i>Then, a suspicious man approached us.</i>

187
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,348
<i>My older brother</i>
<i>told me to beat the man with a stick.</i>

188
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,228
<i>Turns out, it was a bear disguised as man!</i>

189
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,357
<i>The family in the house</i>
<i>only had daughters,</i>

190
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,442
<i>so no one could hunt bears.</i>

191
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,236
<i>The daughters were delighted.</i>

192
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,364
<i>After another long journey,</i>

193
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,909
<i>we reached the sisters' house again.</i>

194
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,995
<i>This time, the father said he wanted us</i>
<i>to marry his daughters.</i>

195
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,415
<i>I became their son,</i>

196
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,001
<i>worked diligently, and lived a happy life.</i>

197
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,552
<i>Then the oldest brother revealed</i>
<i>that he wasn't human</i>

198
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,513
<i>but a bird</i> kamuy<i> called Kesorap all along.</i>

199
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,519
<i>He transformed into a beautiful bird</i>
<i>and spread his wings in the sky.</i>

200
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,146
Pull! Higher!

201
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,606
He's heavy!

202
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,318
Cikapasi, what's with the dazed look?

203
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,613
You can't convey a thing
with that expression!

204
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,491
Listen up, Cikapasi. In this scene,

205
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:30,203
the oldest brother took you in,
took you hunting,

206
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,456
and even fought evil <i>kamuy</i>
to raise you into a man.

207
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,126
Thanks to him,
you were able to have your own family.

208
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,880
You are now parting
with your beloved brother!

209
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,510
<i>The bird's tears turned into rain</i>

210
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,513
<i>and showered down from above.</i>

211
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,140
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>.

212
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,151
Excellent! Was the camera rolling?

213
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,948
{\an8}GOLDEN KAMUY

214
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,033
KANOYA

215
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,077
We rented this playhouse
to hold a showing.

216
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,872
This is all thanks
to Second Lieutenant Koito.

217
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,458
The rich sure know how to spend money.

218
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,602
Oh, no! My balls!

219
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,792
Amazing!

220
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,295
Huh?

221
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,714
Did we film this one?

222
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,924
No.

223
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,051
That's not a Karafuto Ainu dwelling.

224
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,264
Girel noticed something
while he was filming you.

225
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,892
He wants you to watch this reel.

226
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,815
We filmed this in Otaru over a decade ago.

227
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,570
That's my <i>kotan</i>!

228
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,746
Acha!

229
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,252
I still remember his deep-blue eyes.

230
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,004
Wait. Is that Wilk?

231
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,049
So Nopperabou used to look like that.

232
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,555
Then the woman next to him must be…

233
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,690
Girel says you share
a striking resemblance with this woman.

234
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:20,290
Acha said she was good-natured.
She was bright like a sunny day.

235
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,714
She looks like a wonderful person.

236
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,938
Your father came from Karafuto.

237
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,484
He wanted to get Japanese citizenship
to marry her.

238
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,737
I joked and said he'd get conscripted
if another war broke out,

239
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,156
so it was best not to get it.

240
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,118
Did he end up fighting
in the Russo-Japanese War?

241
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,169
Everyone get out!

242
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,589
Girel, don't let the other films burn!

243
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,472
<i>Cinematograph-projected images</i>
<i>use arc lamps,</i>

244
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:22,018
<i>which produce electric arcs and sparks.</i>

245
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:27,023
<i>The film was coated with nitrocellulose,</i>
<i>the same ingredient used in gunpowder.</i>

246
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,317
<i>This often causes accidental fires.</i>

247
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,822
<i>Many historically significant films</i>
<i>have turned to ashes.</i>

248
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,115
Where's Asirpa?

249
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,540
Asirpa!

250
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,629
Are you okay?

251
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,675
Moving pictures is wonderful technology,

252
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:59,681
but it's not enough to document
the entirety of our way of life.

253
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,393
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I saw my mother's face,</i>

254
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,187
<i>but I don't recall that moment.</i>

255
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,233
<i>The things Acha told me about my mother</i>

256
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,527
<i>have stayed with me.</i>

257
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:17,532
If we don't cherish our culture,
it will eventually disappear.

258
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,328
<i>Kiroranke</i> nispa <i>showed me</i>
<i>other tribes and their ways of life.</i>

259
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,292
<i>I would never have learned about them</i>
<i>if I stayed in Hokkaido.</i>

260
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,714
<i>My journey in Karafuto</i>
<i>taught me all these things.</i>

261
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,593
It's like Kiroranke and Acha said.

262
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,388
If we want to protect it,
what else can we do but fight?

263
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,810
But why do you have to fight?

264
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,898
Are you telling me to go back to Otaru
after we find the gold

265
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,400
and chase after bears and deer,

266
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,696
the way I used to?

267
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,617
<i>Kiroranke</i> nispa <i>sacrificed his life</i>
<i>to teach me these things.</i>

268
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,786
<i>I can't just leave now.</i>

269
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,416
But you shouldn't have to fight, Asirpa.

270
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,001
Sugimoto,

271
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,922
are you trying to save me or yourself?

272
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:19,677
I remind you of who you used to be
when you used to eat dried persimmons.

273
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,562
That's a part of it.

274
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,817
But I haven't told you
what Wilk told me in Abashiri

275
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,820
right before he got shot.

276
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:43,618
<i>He said he taught you</i>
<i>mountain-range combat.</i>

277
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,454
<i>He said you'd lead the Ainu someday.</i>

278
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,292
Wilk dragged you into this,

279
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,003
though you were just an innocent child.

280
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,924
And in the end, by giving up his own life,

281
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:02,762
Kiroranke left you no choice
but to protect your loved ones

282
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,722
through fighting.

283
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,725
I can't allow you to.

284
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,853
<i>To lead the Ainu and die.</i>

285
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,773
<i>To fight and kill your enemies.</i>

286
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,902
<i>It's like they left you with a curse.</i>

287
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,739
<i>I've never raised a child.</i>

288
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,660
<i>Maybe soldiers do pass on</i>
<i>their responsibilities to their children.</i>

289
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,205
But is this really what you want?

290
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,586
You said people who kill other men
are destined for hell.

291
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,466
<i>Asirpa, you aren't religious.</i>
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

292
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:47,056
<i>Whoever first came up with hell</i>
<i>may have killed hundreds like I have.</i>

293
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,226
<i>Maybe they're in agony</i>
<i>because they can't return to innocence.</i>

294
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,980
But you aren't like that yet, Asirpa.

295
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,860
I don't want you tangled up
in this war for gold any longer.

296
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,530
By the time you understand,
it'll be too late.

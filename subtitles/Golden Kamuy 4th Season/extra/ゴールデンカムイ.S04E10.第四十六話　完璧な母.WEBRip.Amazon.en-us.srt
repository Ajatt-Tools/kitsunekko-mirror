1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,422
<i>It's gone! It's gone!</i>
<i>I can't find it anywhere!</i>

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,465
It's gone!

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,050
What's wrong, Nikaidou?

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:11,679
My fake hand was gone when I woke up!

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,142
Maybe somebody hid it.

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,145
Since it's always so noisy.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,858
I'm a clairvoyant.
Shall I use <i>ueinkar</i> to find it?

8
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,360
Yes please, Inkarmat.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,243
I'm getting a strong sense
that it is next to Koito <i>nispa.</i>

10
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,206
You had it!

11
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,585
Wow! How did you know?

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,086
So mysterious.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,213
Even I could have guessed that.

14
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,175
Inkarmat is amazing, Tsukishima.

15
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,970
She gets everything straightaway.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,597
It freaks me out!

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,432
What is that you're chewing on?

18
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,018
It's an <i>ikema</i> root,
to keep evil spirits away.

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,811
It's just one yen and 20 sen.

20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,482
Hey, would you stop ripping him off?

21
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,443
You don't believe in her?

22
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,280
Why don't you give it a go
instead of being so skeptical?

23
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,033
I'm fine, thanks.

24
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,536
Shall I show you, Tsukishima <i>nispa</i>?

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,499
Is there something you cannot find?
Or something you wish to seek?

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,381
Don't think that you can win me over.

27
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:36,388
Tanigaki <i>nispa </i>can't come here
because he must return to Hokkaido.

28
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,058
Does that mean I am your hostage?

29
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,146
My chopsticks won't come out!

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,981
Something's stuck inside!

31
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,401
It's a jelly cake.

32
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,456
{\an8}EPISODE 46 - A PERFECT MOTHER

33
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,213
<i>I'm not cold-blooded enough</i>
<i>to kill Saichi Sugimoto.</i>

34
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>Anyway, if a shot to the head</i>
<i>didn't kill him, what will?</i>

35
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,808
<i>Even if I could kill him,</i>
<i>there's no way Asirpa will listen.</i>

36
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,685
<i>No.</i>

37
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,607
<i>And Lieutenant Tsurumi will do anything</i>
<i>to get the information out of her.</i>

38
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,861
<i>Then my actions</i>
<i>will just have hurt Asirpa.</i>

39
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,824
<i>If her granddaughter returns</i>
<i>as a broken shell of her former self,</i>

40
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,410
<i>I wonder how happy</i>
<i>Huci would be about that.</i>

41
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,206
<i>Until this hunt for the gold is over,</i>

42
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,001
<i>I could just pretend</i>
<i>to keep searching for it.</i>

43
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,837
<i>But who knows</i>
<i>how many years that will take?</i>

44
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,843
<i>Then I would never see Inkarmat</i>
<i>or my future child.</i>

45
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,099
<i>In the end, is searching for Asirpa</i>
<i>the only choice I have?</i>

46
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,813
Is it already about nine months?

47
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,815
The baby could be born at any time.

48
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,818
Such a mystical curve.

49
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,363
Even if I ate you,
my stomach wouldn't swell like that.

50
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,411
When I look at you,
it reminds me of my pregnant mother.

51
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,373
<i>I always wanted to be like her.</i>

52
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,253
<i>She looked so perfect</i>
<i>when she was pregnant.</i>

53
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:59,925
<i>I thought she would be even more perfect</i>
<i>holding her newborn, like the Holy Mother.</i>

54
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,388
<i>But she slipped on the stairs</i>
<i>and had a miscarriage.</i>

55
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,352
I'd love to help you with the birth
if you'll let me.

56
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,689
I'd like that.

57
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,983
You saved my life, after all.

58
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,277
But may I have the placenta?

59
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,362
I heard it's very nutritious!

60
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,447
Okay.

61
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,846
I knew you would come.

62
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,227
<i>Where was Inkarmat moved to?</i>

63
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,772
<i>If I ask the people</i>
<i>working at the hospital,</i>

64
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,108
<i>Lieutenant Tsurumi will probably find out.</i>

65
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,697
<i>I might end up bringing more danger</i>
<i>to Inkarmat in my search for her.</i>

66
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,619
<i>I'm selfish to insist</i>
<i>on taking her to escape with me.</i>

67
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,703
KAWANAKA STORE

68
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,289
Here comes a lecherous guy.

69
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,168
<i>Ikema</i> root?

70
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,006
Loitering around the hospital,

71
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,844
with a perky butt, broad chest
and shaggy hair like a bear.

72
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,139
You must be Tanigaki.

73
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,185
My father is in that hospital,

74
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,978
so I'm always visiting.

75
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,148
This is a postcard from Inkarmat.

76
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,110
She told me to give it
to the lecherous bear.

77
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,571
{\an8}This place.

PANORAMIC VIEW

79
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,994
<i>I failed to return Asirpa to Huci.</i>

80
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,998
<i>I'm useless now. All I can do is run.</i>

81
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,419
But at the very least,
I want to be by your side, with the baby.

82
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,130
No matter what danger I face.

83
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,968
I sent that postcard
because I wanted you to come.

84
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,719
So I'm ready.

85
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,472
Your guard, Tsukishima,
has gone to the baths.

86
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,475
He takes long baths,
so gather your things.

87
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,110
Quiet!

88
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,240
<i>Sounds like studded military boots.</i>

89
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,746
<i>Is it coming from the second floor?</i>

90
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,830
If you're here, then it seems to me

91
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,542
that you are disobeying
Lieutenant Tsurumi's orders.

92
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,546
Well, that's your choice,
Private First Class Tanigaki.

93
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,674
Inkarmat, get away!

94
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,887
If you truly think
that it will bring justice, then kill me.

95
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:36,975
Run!

96
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,170
He won't be able to move for two hours.

97
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,589
Get as far as you can.

98
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:15,138
Are you wondering why a selfish,
vicious criminal like me would help you?

99
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,435
It's because Inkarmat
is going to become perfect.

100
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,606
Make sure to appreciate it, Tanigaki.

101
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,067
Ienaga.

102
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,569
Let's go.

103
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,013
Go.

104
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,358
Why would he do that?

105
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:14,114
Maybe because I often told his fortune,
he decided to look the other way.

106
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,742
There's no way
he'd do something like that.

107
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,827
Not the Koito I know.

108
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,802
Are you okay? Inkarmat, are you cold?

109
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,723
What is it? Are you in pain?

110
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,725
It's the shaking. The horse.

111
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,102
Sorry. We went too fast.

112
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,980
But we've escaped the city now.

113
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,816
An abandoned house! Let's rest there.

114
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,739
Wait here, and I'll make a fire.

115
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,659
Tanigaki <i>nispa,</i> your head is bleeding.

116
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,210
It'll be fine with this.
Rest a bit more, and then we'll go.

117
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,420
We need to get further away.

118
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,423
Your leg is bleeding too.

119
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,218
I must have been grazed by a bullet.

120
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,178
I didn't notice in the chaos.

121
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,017
How careless of me.

122
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,901
Inkarmat! Go out the back!

123
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,069
Hurry! Hurry!

124
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,347
Tanigaki <i>nispa.</i>

125
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,946
Are you okay, Inkarmat?

126
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,698
It's morning.

127
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,701
He's being cautious
because we have a rifle.

128
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,620
If we get to the mountains,
we can lose him.

129
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,664
I'm more familiar
with the mountains than him.

130
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,093
What is it? Is someone following us?

131
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,306
I think my water broke.

132
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,272
You helped us well. Thank you.
Please forgive me.

133
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,920
Was I following the horse's blood?

134
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,673
Just a bit further. Hang in there.

135
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,177
You're okay. I'm with you. Hang in there!

136
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,179
Everything's going to be fine!

137
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,370
Huci.

138
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,247
Sorry… I'm back!

139
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,136
Doesn't a soldier from the 7th Division
guard this village?

140
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,222
{\an8}It's okay.

141
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,851
<i>My husband gets him drunk every night,</i>

142
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,730
<i>so even if Osoma stomps on his face,</i>
<i>he won't wake up until noon.</i>

143
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,821
What's Huci doing?

144
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,365
Checking to see if it's a boy or girl.

145
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,493
If it's a boy, we deliver them face down,

146
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,829
and if it's a girl,
then we deliver them face up.

147
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,622
That way, the baby will live a long life.

148
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,042
She can tell which it is
just from touching the belly?

149
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,503
She can figure it out
by feeling how big the pelvis is,

150
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,714
but it is a difficult skill to master.

151
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,843
She says that a spirit
behind her head speaks to her.

152
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,930
Huci has been delivering babies
since she was 19.

153
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,683
She's an <i>ikoinkarmat</i> with rich experience.

154
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,393
A midwife.

155
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,646
She even delivered Asirpa.

156
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,108
Good. I'll leave Inkarmat in your care.

157
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,903
Sergeant Tsukishima knows
about this <i>kotan</i>.

158
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,990
Eventually he'll come looking for us.

159
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,953
-I'll intercept him in the mountains.
-No, Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>! Don't fight him!

160
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,705
I'll be back.

161
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,998
I'm immortal.

162
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,376
You're not immortal! We should escape!

163
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,260
-What happened?
-Stop it!

164
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,140
You only need to kill me!

165
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,476
Don't do anything
to harm Inkarmat or Huci!

166
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,519
Private First Class Tanigaki.

167
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,148
A long, long time ago,
you made a big mistake.

168
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,402
You left the troops
just for your lover and that old woman.

169
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,572
Tsukishima!

170
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,450
That's enough! Stop!

171
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:55,372
Did you follow me
to ensure they got away safely?

172
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,833
What's the point of killing them?

173
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,588
There are other ways to find Asirpa.

174
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,007
Isn't it better to let them go?

175
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,552
Threats have no meaning
if you don't see them through.

176
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,471
We have to set an example.

177
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,433
Remember, if you get in the way,
I'll kill you.

178
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,437
Do you want to betray
Lieutenant Tsurumi too?

179
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,108
Whose side are you on?

180
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,111
Have you lost your trust
and decided to rebel

181
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:30,156
because Lieutenant Tsurumi
used you and your father?

182
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,910
Lower your weapon.

183
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,495
That's an order.

184
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:41,251
I'll see for myself what you
and Lieutenant Tsurumi do in the end.

185
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,004
Tsukishima…

186
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,050
<i>Didn't you say it's okay for</i>
<i>Lieutenant Tsurumi to achieve his goals</i>

187
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,220
<i>and also save people along the way?</i>

188
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,305
Well, I agree.

189
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,269
So I don't mind that he used us for that.

190
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,901
But I want to be certain
of his real purpose!

191
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,364
If there is no justice behind it,

192
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,868
then it can only lead to guilt and regret.

193
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,581
For that reason, we cannot kill them.

194
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,416
It's already too late for me!

195
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,252
<i>I've murdered so many</i>

196
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,421
<i>and used others until they perished.</i>

197
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,881
It's not too late!

198
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,968
<i>I gave up on what was important…</i>

199
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,013
<i>and threw it all away.</i>

200
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,392
I have to do my job.

201
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,773
So severe and cruel…
Is it because of all that you've lost?

202
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,399
Tsukishima!

203
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,451
Inkarmat…

204
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,082
Is the baby…

205
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,257
Inkarmat!

206
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,220
The baby is coming!
I need you all to help!

207
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,931
You! Boil some water!

208
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,017
You! Gather some straw!

209
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,102
You! Look after this baby!

210
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,069
Wait! Gather some of this
from the other houses.

211
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,695
<i>Noyaham.</i>

212
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,739
It's wadding
made from the leaves of mugwort.

213
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,449
Better than cotton for stopping bleeding.

214
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,369
Soak some <i>rasupa kap</i> in hot water.

215
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,120
It creates an antiseptic.

216
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,373
It aids passage through the birth canal.

217
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,584
And hang this <i>tar</i> from an overhead beam.

218
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,127
She can use it to brace herself.

219
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,465
Spread the straw to the left of the hearth
and cover it with a cloth.

220
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,259
That's where she'll give birth.

221
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,099
If the god of childbirth is beside me

222
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,727
and carefully watches over me,

223
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,523
there will be a good and peaceful birth,

224
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,818
and I can present the baby to the gods.

225
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,240
Everyone get inside!

226
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,076
Place the mortar on the earthen floor.

227
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,579
<i>Nisu horipire!</i>

228
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,374
It's an <i>usuodorase.</i>
It protects against difficult births.

229
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,043
Roll it more. More, more!

230
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,297
<i>Huci gripped the wadding</i>
<i>between the soles of her feet</i>

231
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,091
<i>and pressed it into</i>
<i>the pregnant woman's anus.</i>

232
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,844
<i>This is an Ainu technique</i>
<i>known as </i>kemakokiru<i>.</i>

233
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,014
<i>It's used to turn the baby</i>
<i>according to the sex</i>

234
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,057
<i>and draw it out safely.</i>

235
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,300
You did brilliantly, Inkarmat.

236
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,054
Could you hold him?

237
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,644
What a splendid penis.

238
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,812
That's the leftover umbilical cord…

239
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,358
I have a daughter.

240
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,445
Hey, wake up!

241
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,077
We won't say a thing
to Lieutenant Tsurumi,

242
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,330
so you can relax in the town for a week.

243
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,501
And then report that all is well.

244
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,047
Thank you so much,
Second Lieutenant Koito!

245
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,261
Tanigaki <i>nispa.</i>

246
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,014
Osoma! Are you well?

247
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,766
Osoma!

248
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:15,942
Second Lieutenant Koito,

249
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,945
<i>were you being truthful?</i>

250
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,281
Or were you trying to deceive us?

251
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,284
You can think what you like.

252
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,205
But I refuse to believe
that Lieutenant Tsurumi

253
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,375
would sacrifice everyone else
merely to line his own pockets

254
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,712
or to satisfy some lust for power.

255
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,674
It's hard to believe he is a person
with such a trivial purpose.

256
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,969
Don't you have one thing to say

257
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,680
about his true goal?

258
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,727
There may be no such thing
as a real purpose.

259
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,439
He may merely seek to honor his comrades

260
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,566
and see his country prosper.

261
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,199
<i>Those finger bones…</i>

262
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,952
Have you seen those finger bones?

263
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:09,954
Whose finger bones?

264
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,083
Never mind. It probably doesn't matter.

265
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,881
To risk one's life
fighting for your comrades--

266
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,632
That's every soldier's dream.

267
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,260
Isn't that right, Tsukishima?

268
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,639
Your lack of trust
in Lieutenant Tsurumi is unhealthy.

269
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,976
I will place my full trust in him,

270
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,896
and you can trust in me.

271
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,863
Just like this, Tsukishima.

272
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,406
That doesn't make any sense.

273
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,702
{\an8}ONE WEEK LATER

274
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,414
{\an8}I'll report that you escaped.

275
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,168
{\an8}Go south to avoid the others.

276
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,172
Thank you for your kindness, Koito <i>nispa.</i>

277
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,257
Good luck to you all.

278
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,635
Tsukishima <i>nispa,</i>

279
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:10,139
shall I tell you
what my second sight revealed to me?

280
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,226
It's not necessary.

281
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,407
Huci has helped me yet again.

282
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,742
Like always.

283
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,709

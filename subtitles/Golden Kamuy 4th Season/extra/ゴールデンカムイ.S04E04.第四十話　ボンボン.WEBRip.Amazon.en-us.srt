1
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,672
Look!

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,923
What in the world is that?

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,258
Whoa!

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,884
Who is he?

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,512
That's the second son
of the affluent Koito family.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,305
That silver spoon.

7
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,186
{\an8}KAGOSHIMA

8
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,066
{\an8}OTONOSHIN KOITO, AGE 14

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,323
Watch where you're going, idiot!

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,200
I almost killed you!

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,167
You're going nowhere!

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,880
Do you know what you just did?

13
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:50,342
I'm the son of Rear Admiral Heiji Koito
of the Imperial Japanese Navy!

14
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:54,388
You think you'll get away
treating a Koito like this?

15
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,225
If you want a fight,
fight in your own name.

16
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,231
You, old man! Give me your cane.

17
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:05,900
Yes, my young sir.

18
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,212
Impeccable form. And yet…

19
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,969
What's the matter?
You got quiet all of the sudden.

20
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,227
Are you shocked I blocked
your Jigen-<i>ryu</i> strike empty-handed?

21
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:46,065
Or was this your first time
an adult struck your face?

22
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,068
Both.

23
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,334
Interesting trike you got there.
Does it belong to you?

24
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,418
{\an8}EPISODE 40 - SILVER SPOON

25
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,962
{\an8}My father received it as a gift
from an acquaintance in France.

26
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,090
Did you even get his permission?
Won't you get in trouble?

27
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,884
No.

28
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,261
All right then.

29
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:44,141
By the way, how do I get to
Saigo Takamori's grave?

30
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,185
Are you a tourist?

31
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,520
Let me make it even by giving you a ride.

32
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,612
SAIGO TAKAMORI'S GRAVE

33
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,739
That's Saigo's grave over there.

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,033
Thanks, you've been a great help.

35
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,661
The view is nice. Eat with me.

36
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,706
Tsukisappu red bean cakes.

37
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,960
What's "Tsukisappu?"

38
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:14,046
It's the name of the place
where these cakes are made.

39
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,382
What foods are good in Kagoshima?

40
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,386
I'll have to say
those Sakurajima daikon radishes.

41
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,730
ENSIGN HEINOJOU KOITO'S GRAVE

42
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,276
Who rests here?

43
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,778
My older brother.

44
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,240
<i>He's pale-skinned like my mother.</i>

45
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,451
<i>I made fun of him and said his skin</i>
<i>was as white as a Sakurajima daikon,</i>

46
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,453
<i>but he never got upset, not even once.</i>

47
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,872
<i>He was a kind-hearted brother.</i>

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,168
It should've been me.

49
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,088
Want to talk about it?

50
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,510
It's best to release whatever it is
you're holding in.

51
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,013
No, sorry I brought it up.

52
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,099
We've just met, but I let my mouth run.

53
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,685
You have no obligation

54
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,939
to fill the hole your brother left
in your father's heart.

55
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,864
Imperial Japanese Navy,
Ensign Heinojou Koito.

56
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,576
Date of death, September 17, 1894.

57
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,871
He died in the Battle of Yalu River
in the Sino-Japanese War.

58
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,957
My brother and I are 13 years apart.

59
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,209
I was eight when he died.

60
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,379
<i>My brother was on board the</i> Matsushima<i>.</i>

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,632
<i>Fifty-seven lives were lost</i>
<i>to the Chinese missiles.</i>

62
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,344
<i>I heard that my father looked on</i>
<i>from another ship</i>

63
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,431
<i>as the </i>Matsushima<i> was annihilated.</i>

64
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,478
Since his return,
I haven't been scolded once,

65
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,772
but I haven't seen him smile, either.

66
00:05:55,773 --> 00:06:00,569
I'm haunted by the horrific sight
my father must have seen.

67
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,363
I think about my brother's brutal death.

68
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,783
<i>The intense heat cooked him alive.</i>

69
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,660
<i>Body parts blasted all over the deck.</i>

70
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,247
<i>I heard my friends back in Tokyo say that.</i>

71
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,587
Since then, when I'm on a ship
for a long time,

72
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,423
I start thinking about my brother,
and I get seasick.

73
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,676
A man who can't stand being on a boat
longer than a day

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,763
will never become an admiral.

75
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,477
Maybe my brother is longing for company.

76
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,981
I'm relocating to Hakodate
due to my father's work.

77
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,860
Hakodate, huh? You'll like the place.

78
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,863
The view there is similar to Sakurajima's.

79
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,200
A port city stretches down from
the base of the mountain.

80
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,828
You've been to Hakodate?

81
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,123
Tsukisappu is a place
in Hokkaido, you see.

82
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,586
Thank you. Hope to see you again someday.

83
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,258
Do you think we will?

84
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,805
If fate brings us together again,

85
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:14,518
then that time, we'll follow heaven's
will and become friends indeed.

86
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,899
{\an8}HAKODATE

87
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,485
{\an8}OTONOSHIN KOITO, AGE 16

88
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,279
{\an8}There goes Commander Koito's son.

89
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,365
Heard he was known for acting out
at his school in Tokyo.

90
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,451
He's due for the Imperial Japanese
Naval Academy entrance exams this year.

91
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,788
Just look at him,
that silver spoon is doomed to fail.

92
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,921
You're in my way! Hurry up and move!

93
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,181
FOUR DAYS LATER
THE KOITO ESTATE, HAKODATE

94
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,976
So tell me about this army officer

95
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,062
who was extended a special invitation.

96
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,147
{\an8}YUKI KOITO, MOTHER

97
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,150
{\an8}He was known for his keen intellect
in the Tsukisappu Special Services Group.

98
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,776
{\an8}He has a superb command of Russian.

99
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,861
{\an8}IMPERIAL NAVY CAPTAIN
NAKAYAMA

100
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,030
{\an8}Rumor has it that there's nobody
better suited than him.

101
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,114
{\an8}FATHER, HEIJI KOITO

102
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,993
{\an8}You mean no one in the navy
could speak Russian?

103
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,083
I am Second Lieutenant Tsurumi.

104
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,045
Forgive me for entering
through the back gate.

105
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,422
Before we begin,
shall we shut the curtains?

106
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,885
We can't go over the rescue plans
when we can be easily seen.

107
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,684
<i>Otonoshin's trike was found</i>
<i>inside the Russian consulate's gates.</i>

108
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,896
<i>It was abandoned within the premises.</i>

109
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,149
Over the summer,
the Russian embassy remains unstaffed.

110
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,570
Though I did not go inside,
I'm certain that it's vacant.

111
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:52,407
Naturally, he's not held at the consulate.

112
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,369
Does the kidnapper want money?

113
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,915
This city has plenty of children
who come from wealth.

114
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,376
If the Russians are involved
in his disappearance,

115
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,254
then this could get messy.

116
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,095
{\an8}Drink.

117
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,644
He's speaking Russian.
Does he know Japanese?

118
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,728
{\an8}Silence.

119
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,444
<i>I'm a son of a naval admiral.</i>

120
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,532
<i>The Russians want to advance south.</i>
<i>We've suspected that for a while now.</i>

121
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,869
<i>Does this have anything to do</i>
<i>with the fact that my father commands</i>

122
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>the nearly-completed</i>
<i>Ominato Torpedo Division?</i>

123
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,046
<i>My father will never bend to the Russians,</i>
<i>not even to save my life.</i>

124
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,131
VLADIVOSTOK

125
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,093
<i>The Ominato torpedo boat fleet and</i>
<i>Fort Hakodate are the biggest obstacles…</i>

126
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,177
HAKODATE - OMINATO

127
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,846
<i>…for fleets coming from Vladivostok</i>

128
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,141
<i>and sailing through the Tsugaru Strait</i>
<i>towards the Pacific Ocean.</i>

129
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,227
Currently, torpedo boats scheduled
to embark for Ominato

130
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,731
are docked in Hakodate's ports.

131
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,568
Supposing the Russians are behind this,
their aim may be

132
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,739
to have us destroy the fleets
to momentarily immobilize our forces.

133
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,037
Then why haven't we heard
from the kidnappers yet?

134
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,665
Let's get moving, then.

135
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,792
We might just stir the hornet's nest.

136
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,231
It's coming from inside!

137
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,942
Don't go in, sir.

138
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,236
That might be the kidnappers!

139
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,365
Yes, that was most likely the culprits.

140
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,658
But the timing is too perfect.

141
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,870
The Russian consulate is
under enemy watch.

142
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,623
Let's pretend like we didn't notice
and head back for now.

143
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,794
We must always think a few steps ahead.

144
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,589
One wrong step, and we lose.

145
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,842
Please hold on for now, General Koito.

146
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,057
<i>There are 320 active telephone lines</i>
<i>in Hakodate.</i>

147
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,268
<i>If you want to spy</i>
<i>on the Russian consulate with binoculars,</i>

148
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,979
<i>not including public lines and banks,</i>

149
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:32,317
<i>there are over 50 possible hideouts.</i>

150
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,029
We can't raid every suspicious location.

151
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,281
We will be detected
if we make such a bold move.

152
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,786
Once we are ready, we'll head to
the Russian consulate again.

153
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:47,290
Once they call, get Otonoshin on the line
and confirm his safety.

154
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,129
<i>We'll hang up and get their number.</i>
<i>This is how we'll track them down.</i>

155
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,172
Otonoshin…

156
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,217
We'll spare no effort.

157
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,178
Please, hold on to hope.

158
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,027
We found the phone.

159
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,156
But the Koitos have a phone too.

160
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,702
<i>The Russian embassy is nestled</i>
<i>atop the hills of Mount Hakodate.</i>

161
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,455
<i>It can be easily spied on from the city.</i>

162
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,000
The phone exchange closes at 7:00 p.m.

163
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,961
That means no more calls
until 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

164
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,840
Let's turn the lights on
to alert our enemy that we're here.

165
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,556
Suppose the enemy's aim is
to immobilize the Ominato fleet

166
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,100
and Fort Hakodate.

167
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,144
If we destroy our defense line,

168
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,981
the Russian fleet will seize the chance
and swarm our ports.

169
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,484
That's the beginning of a war.

170
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,737
The lives of hundreds of thousands--

171
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,574
No, millions of civilians
will be lost in exchange for my son's.

172
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,661
We cannot save Otonoshin.

173
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,917
{\an8}Eat.

174
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,050
<i>This pastry!</i>

175
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,385
{\an8}Where did you find this?

176
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,640
{\an8}Don't eat it!
It's been left out for a while.

177
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,686
It's almost six.
The phone exchange opens soon.

178
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,730
As soon as we learn their number,

179
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,025
we'll send in the rescue team,
who will storm the enemy base.

180
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,404
It's also possible that the enemy
will quickly move out

181
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,532
after they realize
we tracked their number.

182
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,617
Time is of the essence here.

183
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,953
-Lieutenant Tsurumi.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,207
If the enemy really believes that
I'd betray the navy for my son,

185
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,919
if they think for a second
that I'd destroy our own fleets,

186
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,796
then they've seriously underestimated me.

187
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,633
Otonoshin is still a child
and may not understand.

188
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,010
I don't blame him
if he loathes me entirely.

189
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,015
I will tell Otonoshin to die for Japan!

190
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,604
A true samurai, through and through.

191
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,736
{\an8}HAKODATE PHONE EXCHANGE STATION

192
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,031
{\an8}-<i>Hello, is this line 18?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

193
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,492
<i>You will be connected briefly.</i>

194
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,787
<i>The fort and the destroyer.</i>

195
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,955
{\an8}<i>Destroy them!</i>

196
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,668
They demand the destruction
of the fort and the destroyer.

197
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,171
As we feared.

198
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,465
{\an8}Put the child on the line!

199
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,850
<i>Are you there, my son?</i>

200
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,227
<i>Father!</i>

201
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,564
<i>Otonoshin, you will not be rescued.</i>

202
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,065
<i>Give your life--</i>

203
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,569
I'm sorry I wasn't a son like my brother!

204
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,451
Please just pretend

205
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,494
<i>that you never had me!</i>

206
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,376
Operator, what's the caller's number?

207
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,005
Let's see, they are line 144!

208
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,967
You mustn't connect anyone else
to line 144.

209
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,887
144? Where is that?

210
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,765
That's not on our list!

211
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,684
144 is the phone at the
army training grounds…

212
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,604
<i>that was closed down a few months ago!</i>

213
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,362
The army training base in Hakodate?
That can only be--

214
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,448
Yes. Goryokaku.

215
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,078
<i>That's six kilometers away!</i>

216
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,747
Have your men head there at once!

217
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,334
They don't know that 144 is Goryokaku.

218
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,878
It's faster for just us to go!

219
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,675
Go!

220
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,640
The horse is frightened
of the steep slope! It's refusing to run!

221
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,559
But there's no time to waste!

222
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,812
Otonoshin!

223
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,065
Commander Koito!

224
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,588
The enemy is after us!

225
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,383
He's the one who was spying on us
at the consulate!

226
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,012
He's headed to Goryokaku
because the line won't connect.

227
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,765
We can't let him get ahead. Hurry, sir!

228
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,832
Coming around.

229
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,046
Got him!

230
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,134
Watch out!

231
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,520
Otonoshin!

232
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,866
We're here in Goryokaku!

233
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,373
{\an8}Stay still.

234
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,087
I'll ambush from the back entrance.
Admiral, draw their attention here.

235
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,298
Kill me!

236
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,801
I'll gladly die now

237
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,553
if it means my father
will think better of me!

238
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,477
Otonoshin!

239
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,064
No…

240
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,148
Father!

241
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,608
Tsk.

242
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,653
{\an8}Silver spoon.

243
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,573
Otonoshin--

244
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,216
Father!

245
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,137
Father!

246
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,981
You!

247
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,109
We meet again.

248
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,328
You're awake!

249
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,414
Are you hurt, Otonoshin?

250
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,251
You fought well. I couldn't be more proud.

251
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,429
One on the way and two here.

252
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,890
We can dig up their history,

253
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,435
but don't expect any ties
to the Russian government.

254
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:53,443
They fed me Tsukisappu red bean cakes.

255
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,446
It reminded me of the one we had
in Kagoshima.

256
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,407
Yes. Tsukisappu red bean cakes

257
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,702
are distributed only among
the 25th Infantry unit.

258
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,997
This facility was occupied by the army
until recently.

259
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
Someone must have left them here.

260
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,043
Does your stomach hurt?

261
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,504
I didn't think the man who first gave me
Tsukisappu red bean cake

262
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,882
would also come save me!

263
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,092
It's meant to be.

264
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,263
Tsukisappu red bean cakes
brought us together.

265
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,892
Yep!

266
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,277
{\an8}ASAHIKAWA 7TH DIVISION

267
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,238
All of a sudden,

268
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:43,660
he wants to advance
to the Army Academy, not navy.

269
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,703
He's already been accepted!

270
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,957
It doesn't matter if it's land or sea,

271
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,626
as long as you become
an honorable officer.

272
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,629
Please take good care of Otonoshin.

273
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,927
Admiral, surely your son
will play a crucial role

274
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,056
in bridging the two branches,
which despise one another so much.

275
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,517
I will give all of my blood,
sweat and tears

276
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,268
to serve you!

277
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:13,189
Please teach me well!

278
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,400
Got the jitters?

279
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,530
By the way,

280
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,617
we finally know who the kidnappers are.

281
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,537
<i>All three were crewmen</i>
<i>from a Russian ship.</i>

282
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,999
<i>They had a past criminal record</i>
<i>for robbery and murder in Otaru.</i>

283
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,793
These criminals vanished from the prison

284
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,379
without a trace.

285
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,882
As we suspected.

286
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,888
He's as impressive as ever.

287
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,473
Yep.

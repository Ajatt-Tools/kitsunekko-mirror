<i>Marimos</i> don't suit your taste buds,
spoiled brat?

6
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,622
What? You guys eat <i>marimos</i>?

7
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,375
Wow. When you're poor,
you eat <i>marimo</i> just to get by.

8
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:47,590
Someone! Somebody help!

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,636

I have food right here. Dried peaches.

Here. You can have some,
so please untie me.

16
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,410
Peach?

17
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,455
My uncle in Yamanashi
always sends a box of them.

19
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,253
Now, isn't that yummy?

20
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,172

Good!

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,303
No, not like that!
That's not what I meant!

24
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,394
Not what I meant, but wow!

25
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,314

00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,575
Okay, you're Obencho then.

31
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,163

{\an8}EPISODE 38 - COCOON

36
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,977
{\an8}As a Shinsengumi leader, you overcame
many fierce battles in Kyoto.

37
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,063
You also survived the Hakodate War,

38
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,734
and even broke out of Abashiri Prison
at land's end.

39
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,321
And this is the fate
of such a dignified man.

40
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,249
Ushiyama is gone!

41
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,504
Inconceivable… He smashed
the casket and crawled out!

42
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,507
Damn it, I underestimated
Ushiyama's prowess.

43
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,427
Still, the Korean morning glory's
effects will not wear off

44
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,389
for another 12 hours.

45
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,641
He won't recall this place.

00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,603
Obencho! Are you there?

47
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,188

Were you cold?

50
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,445
Sorry I can't take you to my house.

51
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,157
We're gonna skate today!

52
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,577
Don't be scared. I'll teach you!

00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,455

Mornin'.

56
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,918
A man just stopped by.

57
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,462
He said to give this to Kadokura,
the head jailer.

58
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,216
And how does this bastard know my name?

59
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,428
How should I know?
Anyway, I'll leave it here.

60
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,023
This is…

61
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,317
-Nagakura!
-Nagakura's not here.

62
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,694
Where is he?

<i>He said you're useless</i>
<i>and went to look for them alone.</i>

64
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,578
It's Sekiya.
That bastard's holding Hijikata captive.

65
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,456
He brought this ransom note.

66

<i>Toshizo Hijikata is in a catatonic state</i>

<i>I will tell you his location</i>
<i>in exchange for the tattooed skins.</i>

We have no proof that
Hijikata <i>nispa</i> is still alive.

70
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,979
Sekiya always resorts
to the same old tricks.

71
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,566
He works alone.
He can't be watching his hostage.

72
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,111
He keeps his victims buried alive
while he collects his ransom.

73
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,240
<i>He's precise with his work.</i>
<i>Leaves his victims just above death.</i>

74
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:09,119
<i>He lets fate dictate</i>
<i>whether his hostages live or die.</i>

We don't have any time left
until the exchange.

Let's get going, Obencho.

100
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,360
Or else we'll catch the poor off them.

101
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,576
Please, forgive me!

102
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,536
Obencho, no!

Wait up, Kirawus!

112
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,526
Let's take a quick break.

113
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,069
I can't run anymore.

114
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,821
I'm out of breath.

115
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,907
I'll croak before Hijikata.

117
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,828
We have to find Nagakura <i>nispa</i>

We don't have time for that.

119
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:22,586
Sekiya has no way to tell
how many tattooed skins we have.

120
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,342
We'll bluff our way
and get Hijikata's location outta him.

121
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,719
Bluff how?

122
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,680
We'll fail with a sloppy plan like that,
Kadokura!

123
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,601
Can you come up
with something better? Huh?

124
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,812
See? You can't. It's because you're poor!

125
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,690
You're also unemployed and poor,

126
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,442

Come here, Obencho.

134
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,306
Head jailer Kadokura.

135
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,518
Stop there. Take off your clothes
and toss them aside.

136
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,561
I have to be sure that you're unarmed.

137
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,065
I have a hunting rifle shoved up my anus.

138
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,067
Wanna take a look, Sekiya?

139
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,154
<i>Good grief. Cunning and cautious as ever.</i>

140
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:37,077
<i>Sekiya chose the hand-off location</i>
<i>to be the very center of the lake.</i>

141
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,915
<i>It's at least a kilometer</i>
<i>to the nearest shore.</i>

142
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,418
<i>Not even a professional sniper</i>
<i>can shoot this far.</i>

143
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,883
So, where's the tattooed skin?

144
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,554
I brought them. Look under my overcoat.

145
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,683
If you make any suspicious movements,
the deal is off.

146
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,312
Oh, that would be a problem.

147
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,689
You checked behind you.

148
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,317
Huh? What? I don't know what you mean.

149
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,155
Is the Ainu man on standby over there?

150
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:19,244
The knife you're hiding in your butt.
Is that his?

151
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,750
<i>This is a special knife my father carved.</i>
<i>Handle it with care.</i>

152
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,710
<i>Where are you gonna hide it?</i>

153
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,754
<i>Okay, will do.</i>

154
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,297
<i>So, where will you hide it?</i>

155
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,637
You were thinking of forcing
Hijikata's location out of me.

156
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,891
Your sloppiness hasn't changed.

157
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,521
I'd like to hear what you think, Kadokura.

158
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,691
Do you think God exists?

159
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,029
Over here! If you don't come get it,
I'll throw it away!

<i>and let Sekiya escape.</i>

177
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,216
<i>I'll secretly follow him.</i>

178
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,804
<i>He'll return to Hijikata</i> nispa
<i>and Ushiyama</i> nispa <i>for their skins.</i>

179
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,055
<i>We'll go with that.</i>

180
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,560
<i>I looked in a random direction</i>
<i>to trick you.</i>

181
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,063
<i>Sekiya will maintain distance</i>
<i>from the shores</i>

182
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,899
<i>as he heads farthest away.</i>

183
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:17,070
<i>I'll pretend that I'm chasing him</i>
<i>and direct him to Kirawus.</i>

184
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,322
There he is. The plan is coming together!

185
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,576
Wait!

186
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,538
Ushiyama!

187
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:32,669
<i>The Korean morning glory's effects</i>
<i>wore off at this very moment!</i>

188
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,464
Sekiya, you fucker!

189
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,048
Ushiyama!

190
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,719
Why are you there, out of all places?

191
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,345
This is bad.

192
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,723
Don't let him get away.
Catch him, Kadokura!

193
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,853
You bastard-- Ouch, ouch!

194
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,021
My skin!

195
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,737
I fucked up. I'm so unlucky.

196
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:10,457
Ushiyama, did Sekiya hold you captive?

197
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,336
Where did he take you?
Hijikata might still be kept there.

198
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,466
I don't remember. When I came to,
my head was sticking out of the ice.

199
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:24,012
That prostitute!
Did Sekiya pay her to do that?

200
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:29,142
I remember partaking something
she called an aphrodisiac.

201
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,061
You're such a dickhead.

202
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,688
Betrayed by a prostitute again!

203
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,822
I found this white cocoon
where Hijikata was spotted.

204
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:48,286
Another one was inside
Ushiyama's overcoat, meaning…

205
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,373
The plot thickens!

206
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,750
Isn't that a silkworm cocoon?

207
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,210
I'm freezing.

208
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:59,756
It could've slipped in his pocket
while he was held captive.

209
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,467
Silk can't be produced over the winter.

210
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,886
Some buildings remain unoccupied
over the season.

211
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,971
That's it!

212
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,307
The dots have been connected
and formed a line!

213
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,934
Since we're talking about silk!

214
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,770
The closest production cottages
are over there

215
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,815
and the opposing shore.

216
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,858
Got it. We don't have much time.

217
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,528
We'll split up and corner that bastard!

218
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,207
Sekiya!

219
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,751
Hijikata is inside, isn't he?

220
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,587
Take me to him, now!

221
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,465
Head jailer, I commend you
for finding my hideout.

222
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,969
Don't underestimate Detective Kadokura's
deduction skills.

223
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,597
-Over here.
-What?

224
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,482
I was testing this out just now.

225
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,193
It's a cocoon sorting machine.

226
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,530
It sorts silkworms' sexes

227
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,365
by measuring their weight.

228
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,996
Each room is for different parts
of the silk production process.

229
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,875
Including the residential building,
there are over ten rooms.

230
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,420
Toshizo Hijikata is buried
somewhere on the premises.

231
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,550
Head jailer, this is your trial.

232
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,596
Inside the cocoons
are capsules of wolf's bane, strychnine,

233
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,932
and cyanide, all in lethal doses.

234
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:37,020
Some of the cocoons are not poisoned.

235
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,938
Kadokura, choose a cocoon and swallow it.

236
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,816
I'll do the same and swallow one too.

237
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,777
If I end up poisoned,

238
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,863
I'll tell you where Hijikata is buried
before I die.

239
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,658
But if you swallow the poisoned cocoon,

240
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,619
I swear to you that I will save Hijikata.

241
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,415
Where the hell did you hide Hijikata?

242
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:01,419
Nobody knows better than me
that the casket is running low on oxygen.

243
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,171
He's got another 30 minutes if he's lucky.

244
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,303
I'm intrigued by people
with an unbending will.

245
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,472
Kadokura.

246
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,974
If your path is correct,

247
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,061
fate will choose you, not me.

248
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,481
In reality, you don't give two shits

249
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,526
about the tattooed skins
or the buried treasure.

250
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,405
Your interest was in those
who flock to the riches all along.

251
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,074
<i>Sekiya is driven by</i>

252
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,536
<i>this little life-or-death wager</i>
<i>he calls a trial.</i>

253
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,541
<i>I'm the kind of man</i>
<i>who draws the poisonous capsule.</i>

254
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,503
<i>Even if only one of</i>
<i>the cocoon is poisoned,</i>

255
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,797
<i>I'll end up with that one.</i>
<i>I've no doubt about that.</i>

256
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,344
<i>But… still!</i>

257
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:56,349
<i>If I can offer my life for Hijikata's,</i>
<i>then so be it!</i>

258
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:06,025
Will you listen to my story while we wait
for the outcome?

259
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,946
It was on a Sunday morning.

260
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,702
<i>I was walking home with my young daughter.</i>

261
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,414
<i>She was toddling</i>
<i>just a few steps ahead of me.</i>

262
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,921
<i>There was a sudden explosion.</i>
<i>I lost consciousness.</i>

263
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,934
<i>A part of my daughter's head</i>
<i>and leg had gotten blown off.</i>

264
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:44,272
<i>It took time for me to process</i>
<i>that lightning struck close by.</i>

265
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,695
<i>Why was my daughter chosen?</i>

266
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,157
<i>Why didn't I die?</i>

267
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,203
Does God choose our luck?

268
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,664
He chose to keep a criminal like me alive.

269
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,375
Maybe God doesn't really exist.

270
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,880
It's taken effect within ten minutes.
That's wolf's bane.

271
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,012
Keep… your word. Save… Hijikata.

272
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,640
I'll dig him out right this minute.

273
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,729
How many more minutes…

274
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,273
before I croak?

275
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,484
You'll suffer for a few hours.

276
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,987
This is bullshit.

277
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,964
<i>I'm very sorry, Hijikata.</i>

278
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,591
<i>This is as far as I can go with you.</i>

279
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,013
<i>Toshizo Hijikata</i>
<i>is still useful for my purpose.</i>

280
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,225
<i>I'll relocate him while</i>
<i>he's still incapacitated.</i>

281
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,727
<i>Should I target the Ainu man next?</i>

282
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,647
<i>I could also test Ushiyama's luck</i>
<i>once more.</i>

283
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,911
Never imagined my medicine-trading
days would come in handy like this.

284
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,749
Luck isn't enough
to survive this day and age.

285
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,334
Huh?

286
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,006
Oh, I'm all better.

287
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:38,219
<i>In an attempt to quicken his death,</i>
<i>Kadokura had swallowed more capsules.</i>

288
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,972
<i>They both happened to be</i>
<i>pufferfish poison.</i>

289
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,767
<i>Pufferfish poison, or tetrodotoxin,</i>
<i>and wolf's bane</i>

290
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,853
<i>counteract each other.</i>

291
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,814
<i>The effects of tetrodotoxin</i>
<i>counteracts wolf's bane's.</i>

292
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,569
<i>Miraculously, Kadokura ingested</i>
<i>the proper dose of pufferfish poison</i>

293
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,823
<i>to counteract wolf's bane's toxin</i>
<i>without getting poisoned by tetrodotoxin.</i>

294
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:03,453
<i>Meanwhile, on the edge</i>
<i>of consciousness, Toshizo Hijikata</i>

295
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,290
<i>swallowed sufficient amount of wolf's bane</i>

296
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,959
<i>to suppress tetrodotoxin's lethality</i>
<i>without Sekiya's knowledge.</i>

297
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,924
He swallowed wolf's bane as soon as
he realized he consumed tetrodotoxin?

298
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,844
How did he pick out wolf's bane?

299
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,097
There was also arsenic and strychnine.

300
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,646
If death is imminent,

301
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,231
then I'm forced to take risks.

302
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:37,445
I'll say that fate took my side
because of my grit and experience.

303
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,489
Impossible.

304
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,283
It must have been a miracle.

305
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,662
Yes, only a miracle
could've made this happen.

306
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,997
So there is a God.

307
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,542
Wouldn't you say, Hijikata?

308
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,091
God has finally rebuked me.

309
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,723
He became a heartless murderer
to reconcile

310
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,810
his faith and his daughter's tragic death.

311
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,938
He ended up becoming a monster.

312
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:18,194
He believed his daughter's death
was God's way of punishing him.

313
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,613
I have no interest in religious matters.

314
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,825
My interest lies in this life alone.

315
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,414
How do we use the life we've been given?

316
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,957
That's all I wish to know.

317
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:36,546
Let's at least put his tattoos
to good use.

318
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,216
Hope Kadokura's okay.

319
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,070
<i>Thank you, Obencho.</i>

320
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,074
<i>I'll never forget you.</i>

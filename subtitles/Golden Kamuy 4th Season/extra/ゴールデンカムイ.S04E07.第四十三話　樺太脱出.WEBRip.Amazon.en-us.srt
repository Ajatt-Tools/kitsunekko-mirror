1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,426
He's here!

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,683
When we return to Hokkaido,
ask to see Huci from Otaru.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,396
Lieutenant Tsurumi is stubborn,
but he should allow it.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,648
It's going be okay, Asirpa.

5
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,405
Once we get the girl,
where shall we put her?

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:33,451
At the site of Tsukisappu's
25th Infantry Regiment,

7
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,412
there's a warehouse that hasn't been used
since before the war.

8
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,791
Even the regimental commander
doesn't know there's a basement.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:46,964
<i>Even if it takes us a few years</i>
<i>to find the gold,</i>

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,550
<i>we can keep Asirpa hidden in there.</i>

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,555
Karafuto Advance Unit, excellent work.

12
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,600
I knew that you were capable men.

13
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,313
So this little lady is Asirpa, then?

14
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,328
{\an8}EPISODE 43 -
ESCAPE FROM KARAFUTO

15
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,705
{\an8}I see.

16
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,254
Right! Get Asirpa to the destroyer!

17
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,674
Tomorrow morning, Sugimoto and Shiraishi
will board the ferry

18
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,801
and stand by at Wakkanai.

19
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:59,138
-What?
-Wait. Why aren't we going together?

20
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,642
There is a limit to how many
crew members can board the ship.

21
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,855
But if they stay in Wakkanai,
we're not going to join them again?

22
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,773
Where am I being taken?

23
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,775
You'll find out later.

24
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,321
Are you going to separate us
and lock me up somewhere?

25
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,991
We're just taking you somewhere safe
for your own protection.

26
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,036
You can see Sugimoto whenever you want.

27
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:26,415
My father only told Toshizou Hijikata
of my existence.

28
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,751
He involved me in the search for the gold

29
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,921
to make sure
that it was used for the Ainu.

30
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,173
I want to hear it loud and clear:

31
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:38,177
Do the Ainu exist
in your vision for the future?

32
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,013
Why, of course.

33
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,683
I have my eyes set
on a happy future for all.

34
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,604
All our intentions and actions
will lead us to such a future.

35
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,941
Your help would mean a lot to us, Asirpa.

36
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,442
Yeah, right.

37
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,280
If it's not going to be used for the Ainu,
I won't help you.

38
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,658
The gold originally belonged to the Ainu!

39
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,038
Originally, those were war funds
used to kill Japanese people.

40
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,210
The few who collected gold dust
for that purpose are all dead.

41
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,964
It doesn't mean that all Ainu
have a wish to fight.

42
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,092
How the gold is used
is for the living Ainu to decide!

43
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,720
You will follow in his footsteps.

44
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,890
<i>What? What's with the sweet lies?</i>

45
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,309
Your eyes…

46
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,937
are exactly like your father's.

47
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
Sugimoto,

48
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,554
what I decide to do is up to me.

49
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,514
Hey!

50
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,599
Asirpa! What are you doing?

51
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,609
Poisoned arrows!

52
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,862
One touch, and it's instant death!

53
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,614
Dodge them!

54
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,452
Anyone hit?

55
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,414
They're getting away!

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,919
Those arrowheads
didn't have any poison on them, right?

57
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,756
It knew you were gonna run for it
straightaway.

58
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,718
Return to our chitatap lifestyle
in our kotan,

59
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,095
or go to war to protect the Ainu.

60
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,680
There is more than one choice.

61
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,601
If we're going to be partners,
then no more, "Don't do that."

62
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,938
I want to hear something positive,
like, "Let's do it together!"

63
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,317
Okay, then!
Let's find the gold by ourselves!

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,694
Sugimoto, in there!

65
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,697
What? Am I dead?

66
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,325
The two of you search that way.

67
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,535
Don't forget to check
inside the buildings.

68
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,371
We can get through here.

69
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,373
Did you have a plan
before you started legging it?

70
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,792
I have one.

71
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,212
The ferry?

72
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,257
Yeah, the one that was broken down
leaves port today.

73
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,635
I bet they're going to try
and get on that boat!

74
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,138
We can get to the street through here.

75
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,684
Ah, here you are.

76
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,479
Over there.

77
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,365
Hurry! They're coming this way!

78
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,950
They're over here!

79
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,745
Run!

80
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,913
Stop there!

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,415
You won't escape.

82
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:04,925
Sugimoto!

83
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,010
Don't shoot! You'll hit Asirpa!

84
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,472
Sugimoto! Get up!

85
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,640
Don't move.

86
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,185
You knew this would happen
if you chose to run.

87
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,856
What are you doing? Don't get any closer!

88
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,485
Get away from him!

89
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,115
I am Sugimoto the Immortal!

90
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,300
Second Lieutenant Koito,
let me take a look.

91
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,974
After them, Sergeant Tsukishima!
They're getting away!

92
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,020
Don't pull it out.

93
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,980
Go ahead, Tsukishima.

94
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,149
I'll be fine.

95
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,070
I always warn you not to let your emotions
take over and rush in like that.

96
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,365
<i>And even though</i>
<i>you listened carefully yesterday…</i>

97
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,791
<i>Can't you even pretend</i>
<i>to be worried about him?</i>

98
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,294
You can do it, Sugimoto.

99
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,463
The boat is just a little farther.

100
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,382
Let's go.

101
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,181
Zukin-<i>chan</i>.

102
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,646
Shiraishi!

103
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,065
Asirpa-<i>chan</i>.

104
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,983
Just as I thought!

105
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,401
Get on!

106
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:48,946
Hey, wait!

107
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,281
You can't come too, Tanigaki!

108
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,867
Lieutenant Tsurumi has Inkarmat, right?

109
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,830
Lieutenant Tsurumi and his men
must be keeping watch on the village!

110
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,915
You can't go back!

111
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,920
Tell Huci I had a dream
about meeting her again!

112
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,006
It might bring her some relief to hear it!

113
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,301
I promise I'll be back again!
Please tell her!

114
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,888
Take care, Genjirou Tanigaki.

115
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,156
Private First Class Tanigaki.

116
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,450
Why are you plodding along like that?

117
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:40,038
Weren't you with Yoshitake Shiraishi?
Where did he go?

118
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,464
I saw him escaping with Asirpa
to the town.

119
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,592
Then why didn't you chase them?

120
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,262
Get moving! On your way, Tanigaki!

121
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,098
-I'm a Matagi.
-What?

122
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,142
I'm Tanigaki the Matagi.

123
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,408
They said the boat is about to depart.

124
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,118
Sugimoto.

125
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,411
I'm fine.

126
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,248
A wound like this won't drain my soul.

127
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,043
It's not time for that yet.

128
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,340
What is it, Zukin-<i>chan</i>?

129
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,848
Crap! One of them is coming this way!

130
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,267
Hey, that ship over there!

131
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,103
Don't leave yet! Wait!

132
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,105
Bang. Get him!

133
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,067
You can hit him at this range, right?

134
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,819
The legs! Aim for the legs!

135
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,704
Did you get his leg?

136
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,164
Nice one.

137
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,797
We did it! We escaped Karafuto!

138
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,174
We got away!

139
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,902
Of all the times and places
to make a run for it,

140
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,072
she just had to pick
somewhere like that, didn't she?

141
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,242
If we're going to find the gold
by ourselves,

142
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,661
then we're the ones
who can decide how to use it.

143
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,456
Asirpa is searching for a path
to protect the Ainu,

144
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,042
but only on that allows her
to stand by her own beliefs.

145
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,211
That's what I've decided to believe in.

146
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,549
That's all well and good,

147
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,801
but how are we going to find
the gold by ourselves?

148
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,266
No! They're chasing us!

149
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,602
Prepare the signal lamp!

150
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,361
"Stop the engines immediately."

151
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,738
That's what they're signaling, Captain.

152
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,366
Strange. What do they want?

153
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,036
Please don't stop the ship.

154
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,290
They're only trying
to get hold of this girl.

155
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,041
They've no intention of sinking the ship.

156
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,547
Is that blood you're covered in?
I can see this is no trivial matter.

157
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,134
It'd be better
if you don't ask me why, Captain.

158
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,011
Okay!

159
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,474
In the first place, I'm not taking orders

160
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,186
from those who dare to approach my ship

161
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,438
and threaten to fire on us
with civilians on board.

162
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,523
Full speed ahead!

163
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:02,240
Even so,
their ship is far quicker than ours.

164
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,326
They'll catch us in no time!

165
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,787
That's it!

166
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,207
Can't we cut through the ice
to the other side?

167
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,917
That would buy us time!

168
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,337
What? This ship is no icebreaker!

169
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,465
If we plow into that drift ice,
we'll sink!

170
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,510
Forget that,
just steer the boat toward the drift ice!

171
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,011
Trust me!

172
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,682
Captain! The ferry is changing course!

173
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,602
It seems they're escaping to the east!

174
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,895
Block their way!

175
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,281
They blew open a rift in the ice!

176
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,742
Yes! Exactly as I thought!

177
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,329
I knew if we tried to escape,
they'd fire right in front of our noses!

178
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,914
Typical Sugimoto.

179
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,291
When it comes to threats,
there's nothing you don't know.

180
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,128
Let's escape before the rift closes!
Quick! Go!

181
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,965
Ferry speed increased!

182
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,843
There's drift ice ahead!

183
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,972
How did they get through
to the other side?

184
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:11,685
Did our earlier gunfire
open up an escape route?

185
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,573
It's only a matter of time
until they catch us.

186
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,576
Right. Come on, Shiraishi!

187
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,743
What is it?

188
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,579
Grab some white cloth!

189
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,873
What are we doing? Raising a white flag?

190
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,212
The ferry has stopped.

191
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,091
It's started to move.

192
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,845
It's turning around and coming this way!

193
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,646
Show yourself, Saichi Sugimoto!

194
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,149
They just got off the ship!

195
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,442
Got off the ship?

196
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,571
Search the ship!

197
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,615
Are you hiding them?

198
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,575
And why would I do that?

199
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:13,079
They just got off
when we stopped over there!

200
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,958
<i>Like I said, they ran away!</i>
<i>Over the drift ice!</i>

201
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,961
I can't see them.

202
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,007
If they're on foot,
there's no way they'd disappear so fast.

203
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,636
I'll go down onto the ice
and chase after them.

204
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,804
No.

205
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,932
<i>One of them was able to shoot someone</i>

206
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:37,062
<i>from a ferry docked 200 meters away.</i>

207
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,565
<i>You'll be a perfect target</i>
<i>out in the open on the ice.</i>

208
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,654
All land troops to transfer to the ferry
and head to Wakkanai.

209
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,447
Head south from Wakkanai

210
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,325
and search the villages
on the Okhotsk coast.

211
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,660
Yes, sir.

212
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,872
What a shame. I wanted to have a nice,
long conversation with her.

213
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,542
We've done it. They're not chasing us.

214
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,169
We've outrun them for now.

215
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,924
We were two hours from reaching Wakkanai
on the ferry.

216
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,635
We should be able to reach it
by foot somehow.

217
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,097
Lieutenant Tsurumi and his crew
must be ahead of us.

218
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,183
We need to take a long detour
to outsmart them.

219
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,560
Sounds rough.

220
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,065
Shouldn't we threaten to kill
Asirpa's relatives?

221
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,400
Usami,

222
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,779
if you're gonna threaten someone,
you gotta do it before they run away.

223
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,949
Geez. Obviously, I know that.

224
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,953
What if we place an obituary
for her grandma in the newspaper?

225
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:39,916
Killing an old lady just to make
an example isn't really my style.

226
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,214
We don't actually have to kill her.
Just put out a fake obituary.

227
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,383
It'll get our intentions across to her.

228
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:53,471
If the girl is still hesitant
and not determined in her resolve,

229
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,766
a threat might just push her
in the right direction.

230
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,187
We didn't have a choice.

231
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,984
If we had handed over the gold,
it wouldn't have been used for the Ainu,

232
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:10,905
even though the Ainu gathered
the gold dust for themselves.

233
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,324
Right, Sugimoto?

234
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,034
I expect so.

235
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,495
Actually, last night,

236
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,292
Shiraishi managed to eavesdrop
on Sergeant Tsukishima's conversation.

237
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,004
I didn't really understand
everything they were saying,

238
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,174
but Lieutenant Tsurumi
wants to use the Ainu gold

239
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:33,803
to overthrow the government
and advance forward into Manchuria.

240
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,848
It seems that Hokkaido
is just the beginning of his vision.

241
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,644
As for that lot, Ainu independence
is the last thing on their minds.

242
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,565
<i>There were many Ainu in the 7th Division.</i>

243
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:52,030
<i>They'd say they fought on the same side</i>
<i>against Russia as Japanese people.</i>

244
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,742
If I'm honest, when Asirpa dodged
being handed over to those men,

245
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,036
I thought, "Serves you right."

246
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,539
After all, what was the point
of Kiroranke's death?

247
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:05,502
Why did Kiroranke <i>nispa</i> go to war?

248
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,631
Was it to protect his family in Japan
from Russia?

249
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:14,219
Kiro-<i>chan</i> only told me that story once.

250
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,387
<i>With Wilk gone,</i>

251
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,974
<i>he became confused and uncertain</i>
<i>about independence for the Far East.</i>

252
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,228
<i>He said, "At least now I can keep</i>
<i>fighting against the Russian Empire</i>

253
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,980
<i>using my own methods.</i>

254
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,484
<i>I will kill as many Russians as I can."</i>

255
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,532
<i>Using death and war to resolve things</i>

256
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,117
<i>is very quick and simple.</i>

257
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,288
<i>But the path Asirpa wants to take</i>

258
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,542
<i>is an infinitely more difficult one.</i>

259
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,877
Asirpa,

260
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,257
what did you say to Kiroranke back then?

261
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,555
Perhaps you figured out a way
to unravel the code?

262
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,641
Yes.

263
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,269
What? Really?

264
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,855
Then, what was it?

265
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,148
It was…

266
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,779
Wait. You keep it to yourself, Asirpa.

267
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,032
Tell me when the right time comes.

268
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,617
<i>Yes.</i>

269
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,203
<i>It's not time just yet.</i>

270
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,331
<i>Sugimoto is far too kind.</i>

271
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,878
<i>If I tell him how to solve the code,</i>
<i>he'll probably leave me behind</i>

272
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,213
<i>and go hunt down the gold by himself.</i>

273
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,676
<i>Until his soul leaves his body,</i>
<i>he'll keep fighting and hurting alone.</i>

274
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:41,764
<i>He'll stay by my side as long as</i>
<i>I don't reveal how to solve the code.</i>

275
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,977
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can protect this man from gunfire.</i>

276
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,688
<i>I will become his strongest shield.</i>

277
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,399
<i>And when the time comes--</i>

278
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,568
<i>yes, when there is good reason--</i>

279
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,156
<i>I will be ready to plunge into hell</i>
<i>with Saichi Sugimoto.</i>

280
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,203
What is it?

281
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,045
Over there.

282
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,676
Who stripped off his uniform?

283
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,679
Well, see, there was a man…

284
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,683
Where was the ferry docked?

285
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,519
Way over there.

286
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,605
That takes a lot of skill…

287
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,108
Why are you taking his clothes?

288
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,861
He won't be using them anymore, will he?

289
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,989
And this gun…

290
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,452
must want to keep shooting people
until the day it breaks.

291
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,873
His clothes, shoes and bags…

292
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,001
Did the <i>meko oyasi</i> eat everything?

293
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,719

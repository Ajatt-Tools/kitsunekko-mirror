00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,463
<i>Karimpani.</i>

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:06,215
When Sergeant's cherry trees blossom,

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:10,344
the color of the deer's fur changes,
and we know that the meat is tastier.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,013
What a handy morsel of information.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,309
We wind the bark around our bows
to prevent them from snapping.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,062
We wrap it around our <i>makiri</i>
and quivers too,

7
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:23,357
and use it when we bind boards
for <i>itaomacip</i> boats.

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:26,152
So it's indispensable
for making hunting tools.

9
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,739
That spindle tree is a <i>kasupni.</i>

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,699
It means "ladle tree."

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,828
<i>It's strong and has a fine grain,</i>
<i>so we use it to make ladles and spatulas.</i>

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,706
<i>We use it for our </i>kite<i> harpoons</i>
<i>when we make a big catch</i>

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,876
<i>and also for making</i>
<i>the </i>heperay <i>flower arrows</i>

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,336
<i>we give as an offering</i>
<i>during bear-sacrifice ceremonies.</i>

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,008
<i>The flower arrows lead the bear cubs</i>
<i>to where the </i>kamuy <i>live.</i>

16
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,177
What a valuable tree.

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,058
{\an8}EPISODE 49 - THE MISSING KAMUY

18
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,393
{\an8}Hey, Usami.

19
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,146
Take it easy. You're gonna set it on fire.

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,775
But this is how I got results before.
It's my best method.

21
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,276
So keep it quiet!

22
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,864
Just like that weirdo Ogata
from the 7th Division.

23
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,241
Don't lump me in with him!

24
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,703
That spoiled, snot-nosed brat! Bastard!

25
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,333
Do you remember
Second Lieutenant Yuusaku Hanazawa?

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,420
Ogata's half brother,
who was killed on 203 Meter Hill!

27
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,505
Bastard!

28
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,092
Of course I remember.

29
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,928
Well, here's what happened.

30
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,933
<i>After Ogata was pushed</i>
<i>into the frozen river by Sugimoto…</i>

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,316
Yuusaku…

32
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,530
Yuusaku?

33
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,034
<i>In his delirious state, he uttered</i>
<i>the name of the brother he killed!</i>

34
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,704
Ogata was the one
who killed Second Lieutenant Hanazawa?

35
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh, you didn't know?

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,501
Why would he do that?

37
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,254
<i>They seemed close.</i>

38
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,716
{\an8}THE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR
SIEGE OF PORT ARTHUR

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,637
Lieutenant Tsurumi said not to kill him?

40
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,932
Even after all that talk

41
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,685
of getting rid of Yuusaku
to get your father on your side,

42
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,938
all so that you could manipulate him.

43
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,898
What a mess.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,820
He must have decided Yuusaku was valuable

45
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,989
after realizing how highly
everyone regards him.

46
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,908
That's just because of who his father is.

47
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,578
It's just exaggerated glorification,
don't you think?

48
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,872
So you agree.

49
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:48,210
If we could expose his true character,
Lieutenant Tsurumi would change his mind.

50
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,629
Stripped of our shiny exteriors,
we're all the same.

51
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,677
You don't feel a shred of remorse
for killing a Russian soldier, do you?

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,761
Not at all.

53
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,432
Because they deserved to be killed, right?

54
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,975
Yes, yes. Exactly.

55
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,604
Anyone can commit a crime.

56
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,733
So you wouldn't feel guilty
if you killed him, would you?

57
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,817
Not at all.

58
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:17,948
Humans are all born the same,
whether their parents love them or not.

59
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,408
Exactly.

60
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,620
So I'm not that weird after all.

61
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,542
I want to see you kill him.

62
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,669
I can't!

63
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,426
Unfortunately, he couldn't see past
Yuusaku's shiny exterior.

64
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,054
I give up.

65
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,765
In the end, maybe I am weird.

66
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,935
Because I'm the unloved child
of a mistress.

67
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,188
No, wait.

68
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,777
What if my father actually loves me too?

69
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,074
Then there would be no difference
between me and Yuusaku.

70
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,078
Yuusaku isn't such a pure soul.

71
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,622
Maybe deep down,
he also has the ability to kill people

72
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,625
and continue living
without being plagued with guilt.

73
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,587
Well, how can I test my father's love?

74
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,091
I guess the best way
would be to get rid of Yuusaku.

75
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,093
Right?

76
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,345
Right.

77
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,601
<i>Well, things went as originally planned.</i>

78
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,357
<i>But would it make Lord Hanazawa</i>
<i>love the child he once abandoned?</i>

79
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,401
Well, obviously,

80
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,445
Lord Hanazawa didn't blink an eye!

81
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,992
So Yuusaku died pure,

82
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,160
leaving Ogata feeling all gloomy!

83
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,620
Cute, right?

84
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,832
Geez, this guy…

85
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,917
Whoops!

86
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>I know you were planning a revolt.</i>

87
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,345
What is it that riles you
about Lieutenant Tsurumi?

88
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,766
Is it just that one thing?

89
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:23,198
Now you will find
a lost god of war within yourself.

90
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,743
You did well, Hyakunosuke Ogata.

91
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,630
Did you kill Lord Hanazawa

92
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:42,134
to become divisional commander
of the 7th Division?

93
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,513
No. There were many things
I wanted to discuss with him.

94
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,141
Or were you hoping
for Lieutenant Tsurumi to love you

95
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:53,270
by strengthening
your position within the division?

96
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:54,980
No.

97
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,983
You should find out
about the Manchuria Railway.

98
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,779
Your father was simply
in Lieutenant Tsurumi's way.

99
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,742
Even though you killed Yuusaku,
your father still didn't love you.

100
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:11,663
And now you've killed your father,
and Lieutenant Tsurumi doesn't love you.

101
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,750
And it's gnawing away at you.
Not a soul loves you.

102
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,629
And now you resent Lieutenant Tsurumi,
blaming him for everything!

103
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,256
Get it through your head.

104
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,468
We're all just pawns in his game.

105
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,678
Just look at Sergeant Tsukishima!

106
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,431
He knows damn well that he's only a pawn!

107
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,185
Lieutenant Tsurumi, that was amazing.

108
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,145
Excellent, in fact.

109
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,189
What are you talking about?

110
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,193
<i>You called Sergeant Tsukishima</i>
<i>a comrade in arms.</i>

111
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,738
<i>You said it so that everyone would hear.</i>

112
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,117
You had everyone spellbound
with that little act of yours.

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,577
It boosted their morale

114
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:54,331
and got everyone to pull together
and fight for you.

115
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,626
Amazing…

116
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,714
I want to be used like a pawn,
just like Sergeant Tsukishima.

117
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,301
Nothing could be better.

118
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,472
I don't think of my men as pawns.

119
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,015
Yes, yes, of course.

120
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,561
But if you called me a comrade in arms,

121
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,938
I'd spurt one out.

122
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,524
You, me,

123
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:25,028
Sergeant Tsukishima, Yuusaku and Koito--
We're all just pawns!

124
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,907
You grew a pair
and defied Lieutenant Tsurumi.

125
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,078
You've become obsessed,
fueled by both love and hate.

126
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:36,248
I know it all too well.
I can see right through you.

127
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,417
Pawns…

128
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,169
What?

129
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,422
If your unimaginative delusions
are correct,

130
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,008
then a peasant like you

131
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,636
is his cheapest pawn.

132
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,776
Superior Private Usami,
is everything okay?

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,030
He hit me with the bedpan.

134
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,325
Private First Class Mishima
has gone after Ogata.

135
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,577
Did you hear what he said?

136
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,164
He said I was the cheapest pawn.

137
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,917
No. I didn't hear a thing.

138
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,961
It's not true, is it?

139
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,006
Bastard. That bastard.

140
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,510
Hyakunosuke Ogata
will surely appear again!

141
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,847
So he can make life hell
for Lieutenant Tsurumi!

142
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,193
NOGUCHI HOTEL

143
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,240
Ogata shot us a duck.

144
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,408
I finally got used to shooting
left-handed.

145
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,913
You're making a full comeback as a sniper.

146
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,498
Not quite…

147
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,294
I'll be a sniper again
once I shoot a person.

148
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,807
Sugimoto never leaves Asirpa's side.

149
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,685
Yeah, that kid's hunting skills
come in handy.

150
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,356
I still don't really understand
why you're hanging around with them.

151
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,736
Why would you cross the 7th Division
or Toshizou Hijikata?

152
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,116
You just pick the winning side.

153
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,617
That's not it.

154
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,160
I'm just going with the flow,

155
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,289
but my share will be bigger
if I have to divide it with fewer people.

156
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,750
You seem pretty certain of success.

157
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:53,552
That girl has the same deep-blue eyes
as Nopperabo.

158
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,178
So what?

159
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,141
Lots of Ainu people have Russian blood.

160
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,103
Neither of us trusts the other.

161
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,690
But if you're not prepared
to share more information with me,

162
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,984
I'm not going to risk my life.

163
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,946
It's just a feeling,

164
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,035
but I think Asirpa knows
how to solve the code.

165
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,372
So, I'm guessing she told you too?

166
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,499
No.

167
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,919
I see.

168
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,174
So I guess he doesn't trust me either.

169
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,135
Look at this, Shiraishi.

170
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,179
Gotcha.

171
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,598
What is it?

172
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,725
A gold coin?

173
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,770
It was with some gold dust
at the bottom of Lake Shikotsu.

174
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,775
Don't these markings
look similar to our tattoos?

175
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,277
An <i>at kamuy!</i>

176
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,489
Look at it's perfect
little round head! Cute!

177
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,866
Shall I catch it
and use it to make you gloves?

178
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,034
Oh, no! Don't!

179
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,953
<i>At kamuy</i> means "god of nursing."

180
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,663
They help people.

181
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,499
<i>Horkew kamuy</i> are the same.

182
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,294
This is about where I found Retar
in the woods as a child.

183
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:16,218
That star and the two next to it
are <i>ku nociw.</i>

184
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,719
The stars form a bow.

185
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,764
It does look like a bow!

186
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,309
And that's <i>ay nociw.</i>

187
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,477
The arrow stars.

188
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,523
That's <i>siarsarush kamuy noka nociw.</i>

189
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,317
The stars are shaped like a bear
with a long tail.

190
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:38,240
And here, near these two stars,
what shape do you see?

191
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,699
Well…

192
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,702
It looks like a winky!

193
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,330
No, I don't think winky stars exist.

194
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,291
It's the <i>horkew kamuy nociw</i>.

195
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,211
Those are the forelegs,
and that's the tail.

196
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,213
What kind of god is a <i>horkew</i>?

197
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,386
It's the missing <i>kamuy</i>.

198
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,056
<i>After that, I came across Retar</i>

199
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,268
and realized
what a <i>horkew kamuy</i> looks like.

200
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:11,940
I hope children of future generations
also get to see them,

201
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,777
if Retar's offspring flourishes
in this forest.

202
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,320
Right, Asirpa?

203
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,703
<i>Acha's name was Horkew Oshikoni.</i>

204
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,956
<i>It must be a key to solving the code.</i>

205
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,294
<i>My mother gave him an Ainu name,</i>
<i>and he somehow put it into the code.</i>

206
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:37,090
<i>How could someone like Acha</i>
<i>kill so many Ainu people for their gold…</i>

207
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,844
<i>Is that why Kiroranke</i> nispa <i>killed him?</i>

208
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,473
<i>Acha, Kiroranke</i> nispa <i>and countless others</i>

209
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,475
<i>had their fates shaken up</i>
<i>by the buried gold.</i>

210
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,145
<i>Is it really worth finding it?</i>

211
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,857
<i>If I don't tell Sugimoto</i>
<i>the key to the code,</i>

212
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,151
<i>he'll never leave me.</i>

213
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,362
<i>Then I can still protect him.</i>

214
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,033
<i>I hope we never find the gold</i>

215
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,535
<i>and stay together forever.</i>

216
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,871
Sugimoto.

217
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,917
What will you do if we find the gold?

218
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,552
Return to your old home
to live with the woman you love?

219
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,932
<i>If we find the buried gold,</i>

220
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,601
<i>will he leave?</i>

221
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,898
What's that? The cut in the tree.

222
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:37,859
That tree too.

223
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,863
All the trees around here
have big slashes cut into them.

224
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,282
We need to get out of here quickly.

225
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,492
Hurry, Sugimoto!

226
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,879
What was that?

227
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,443
This is the method used
to fell trees in Hokkaido.

228
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:25,907
They cut into lots of large trees,
then topple one that faces the wind.

229
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,160
Then the others tumble down like dominoes.

230
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,290
Sugimoto and Asirpa were in the forest!

231
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,709
I hope they didn't get caught
in the falling trees!

232
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,003
-Sugimoto!
-Hey!

233
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,713
Asirpa!

234
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,215
Asirpa!

235
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,177
Asirpa!

236
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,933
Sugimoto, are you okay?

237
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,602
Forget about me.

238
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,145
Are you hurt?

239
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,398
Are you trapped?
Are your arms or legs pinned down?

240
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,984
I don't know.

241
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,861
Okay, hold on. Stay with me.

242
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,946
Hang in there.

243
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,871
Lord Togo!

244
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,541
Once again, Lord Togo, come to me.

245
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,961
VICE ADMIRAL KAMIMURA

246
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,632
That's no way for you to get ahead!

247
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,092
Are you expecting me to let you win?

248
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,595
By the way,

249
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,098
Lieutenant Tsurumi
wants us to wait in Sapporo.

250
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,893
They've stopped the search for Asirpa
and are heading--

251
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,404
Do you know her?

252
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,281
No.

253
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,534
But she looks dangerous.
Please be careful.

254
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,128
<i>I have to control myself for now</i>

255
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,132
<i>so I can find where Asirpa is.</i>

256
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,719
Is anybody there? Shiraishi!

257
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,310
<i>Return to your old home</i>
<i>to live with the woman you love?</i>

258
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,064
There's a woman called Ume.

259
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,653
<i>I was supposed to be with Ume.</i>

260
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,866
<i>But when my whole family</i>
<i>succumbed to tuberculosis,</i>

261
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,369
<i>I had to leave.</i>

262
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,876
<i>So Ume married Toraji.</i>

263
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,177
<i>Toraji and Ume were my childhood friends,</i>

264
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,097
<i>so I was relieved</i>
<i>because I knew he would treat her well.</i>

265
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,436
<i>But Ume contracted an eye disease</i>
<i>and needed expensive treatment.</i>

266
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,736
<i>But Toraji…</i>

267
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,331
If I told her I hurled you into the air,

268
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,918
would Ume believe me?

269
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,217
Sugimoto!

270
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,261
Asirpa!

271
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,848
Sugimoto!

272
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,267
Asirpa!

273
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,479
You seem awfully desperate to find them.

274
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,273
Seems like that girl
is your winning ticket after all.

275
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,276
She's Nopperabo's daughter, right?

276
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,778
How about it, Shiraishi?

277
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,488
Shut it, will you.

278
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,240
It doesn't matter right now.

279
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,952
To keep my promise,

280
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,498
I need to return home
and give Toraji's wife the money.

281
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,461
It's just like you
to want the money for such a reason.

282
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,590
In that case,
you really do need the buried gold.

283
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,842
But even if we find it,

284
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,137
until we reach an outcome
that you are happy with,

285
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,098
I'll be here with you as your partner.

286
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,897
<i>That isn't exactly what I wanted to hear.</i>

287
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,400
First we need to get free.

288
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,070
Shiraishi will come and help us.

289
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,155
He might be trapped too.

290
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,118
Even so, he'll break his back to find us.

291
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:43,915
Shiraishi wants the gold too,
but for very different reasons.

292
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,793
He's just hell-bent on getting rich.

293
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,587
That may be true,

294
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,965
but he kept his promise

295
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,968
and stayed with you
the whole time at Karafuto.

296
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:01,349
So, you can tell him
just like you told me:

297
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:06,062
that you remembered the key
to solving the code.

298
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,439
Yes, I suppose.

299
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,945
I should have told him sooner,
but somehow I didn't mention it.

300
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,074
<i>At kamuy</i> has come to help us.

301
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,871
I'm glad Karafuto wasn't a waste!

302
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,789
Shiraishi!

303
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,041
How did you know where we were?

304
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,836
<i>Zukin-</i>chan<i> saw you.</i>

305
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,463
Hey! We need help!

306
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,341
Someone's caught under the trees
you chopped down!

307
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,843
What a disaster!

308
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,511
Where?

309
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,571
The <i>kamuy</i> that was here-- Where did it go?

310
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,827
Wow. Look at the state
of this side of the forest.

311
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,329
I hadn't noticed that before.

312
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,582
We also cut down trees to survive.

313
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,417
Just like the Japanese,

314
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,421
we kill deer, bears and wolves
to sell their skins.

315
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,926
You can't blame people
for wanting to live well.

316
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,137
But you shouldn't take too much.

317
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:26,643
<i>We return some of the animals we catch</i>
<i>to the mountains</i>

318
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,437
<i>and leave some of the wild plants,</i>

319
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,648
<i>so that there will be more</i>
<i>the following year.</i>

320
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,359
<i>That's what we've always done.</i>

321
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:39,322
If we leave something behind,
then the <i>kamuy</i> will stay with us.

322
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,075
Acha was the one who told me that.

323
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,369
Boutarou,

324
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,580
show Asirpa that coin.

325
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,375
She's Nopperabo's daughter.

326
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,085
Hey, Shiraishi.

327
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,544
It's okay, it's okay.

328
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,421
Boutarou already guessed.

329
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,841
This was at the bottom of Lake Shikotsu.

330
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,176
You have it, Asirpa.

331
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,182
The pattern looks like our tattoos,
so maybe Wilk made it.

332
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,895
This cross looks like an Ainu design.

333
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,065
It means "taking turns" or "crossing."

334
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,776
Perhaps they melted down some of the gold

335
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,571
that was collected by the Ainu people
in the olden days

336
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,702
and made this to commemorate the dream
of building their own nation.

337
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,038
<i>In Russia, Acha once told Sofia</i>

338
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:33,459
<i>that the Ainu and other minority groups</i>
<i>of the Far East should unite.</i>

339
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:38,631
<i>If he kept tight hold of this</i>
<i>until it was lost to Lake Shikotsu,</i>

340
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,052
<i>then he must have been dedicated</i>
<i>to that dream.</i>

341
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,807
<i>Acha wouldn't kill the people</i>
<i>he wanted to save.</i>

342
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,936
Acha didn't kill the Ainu.

343
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,400
Now I finally know

344
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,362
what I need to do for my people.

345
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:39,961
GOLDEN KAMUY'S FINAL ARC ANNOUNCED!

1
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,893
I'm a Matagi. I'm Tanigaki the Matagi.

2
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,979
What the hell are you talking about?

3
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,149
I'm leaving.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,779
Inkarmat isn't in Abashiri anymore.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,573
She was moved somewhere else.

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,285
{\an8}Are you saying you'll kill her if I leave?

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,079
Oh, no. Not at all.

8
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:40,291
You wouldn't possibly make me do
something so horrific.

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,002
Would you, Genjirou Tanigaki?

10
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:48,382
I'm not cut out for searching for gold
or overthrowing the government.

11
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,927
{\an8}I just want to live a simple life.

12
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,389
Is it so wrong that I want to live
as one of the people?

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,768
The people don't know a damn thing

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,687
about those who risked their lives
and got nothing from it.

15
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,773
But you know.

16
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,900
Can you turn a blind eye to that?

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,862
I won't be of any use to you
even if you do hold her hostage.

18
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,948
{\an8}My presence will only lower morale.

19
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,159
{\an8}I'm sure you've got it in your head

20
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:20,206
{\an8}that she'll escape on her own
once she recovers,

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,833
but it won't be so easy this time.

22
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,919
What have you done to Inkarmat?

23
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:29,465
She's pregnant with your child.

24
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,931
My child?

25
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,936
If you bring Asirpa back,

26
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,606
I promise to release
both you and Inkarmat.

27
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,570
You were originally supposed to bring
Asirpa back to her grandmother, right?

28
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,697
Tanigaki.

29
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:01,330
{\an8}I know you won't trigger
Saichi Sugimoto's defenses.

30
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:09,338
{\an8}EPISODE 45 - COMPLICITY

31
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,761
So this kanji is <i>ro</i>?

32
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,763
Yeah, that's <i>ro</i>.

33
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,891
{\an8}This one is either <i>shi</i> or <i>sa</i>.

34
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,606
Who would have guessed
that Master Heita was a convict?

35
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,777
But now with a new tattooed skin,

36
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,238
we're right back on track.

37
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,117
We're after a much bigger pile of gold,
remember?

38
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,743
That's right.

39
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,787
And if we find it,

40
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:46,876
we might even discover
who killed the Ainu and stole their gold.

41
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,919
Boy, that was close.

42
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,547
All that <i>haku</i> business nearly derailed us.

43
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,384
This is no time to be digging around
for placer platinum.

44
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,720
Yep, onward and upward.

45
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,930
Heita's tobacco case.

46
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,017
You don't often see bears
carved into them.

47
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,228
They say it can possess you
and cause all sorts of trouble.

48
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,481
It's kind of heavy.

49
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,817
Placer platinum?

50
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,695
-Give it here!
-It's mine!

51
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,242
Get a load of this.

52
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:24,955
Looks like he kept gold samples
from every river he went to.

53
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,918
They say that gold has a face.

54
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,171
Each face has a different characteristic
based on where it's from.

55
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,549
<i>A skilled gold prospector</i>
<i>can look at the face</i>

56
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,510
<i>and say exactly which river it comes from.</i>

57
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:44,892
<i>The Ainu gathered all the gold</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere long ago, right?</i>

58
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,895
<i>They thought the buried treasure</i>
<i>would bring misfortune,</i>

59
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,397
<i>and so they kept it hidden from everyone.</i>

60
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,692
<i>There were only a few people</i>
<i>old enough to remember where it is.</i>

61
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,405
<i>Those were the seven that were killed</i>
<i>in the Nopperabou incident.</i>

62
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,909
But that's not to say
there aren't others out there

63
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,495
who also know where the gold is.

64
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,207
And that's why Nopperabou
went and moved the treasure, right?

65
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,417
Yeah, but he did it by himself.

66
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,254
It can't have been easy for one man
to move all that gold on his own,

67
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:18,092
so I think he was only able to move it
somewhere close by.

68
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:23,097
Now, how would you go about searching for
the Ainu who knew where it originally was?

69
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:28,102
It's likely that they still live near
the rivers where they found the gold dust.

70
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,980
So if you can identify the gold,

71
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,024
you can find out which river it came from.

72
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,359
What?

73
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,988
How are you meant to identify the gold
if it's hidden away somewhere?

74
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,993
Have you forgotten already?
Nopperabou took some of the gold and ran,

75
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,496
<i>but his boat capsized,</i>
<i>and the gold sank along with it.</i>

76
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,498
Lake Shikotsu?

77
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,334
Are you saying we should search there?

78
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,254
We should completely change course
from the tattooed skins

79
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,464
and look for the buried treasure there?

80
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,718
No way is that gonna work.

81
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,220
Lake Shikotsu
is the deepest lake in Hokkaido.

82
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,765
Diving all the way to find the treasure
would be impossible.

83
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,183
It's not impossible.

84
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,436
{\an8}LAKE SHIKOTSU, THE PIRATE

85
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,438
Check this out.

86
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,981
They found it already?

87
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,234
Who's "the pirate"?

88
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,904
{\an8}One of the escaped Abashiri convicts.

89
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,491
{\an8}And quite a tough and feisty one at that.

90
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:28,245
{\an8}ONE YEAR AGO, LAKE SHIKOTSU

91
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,875
You should wait till it's warmer.
You'll die, you know?

92
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,294
Then someone else will just beat me to it.

93
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:39,089
Not even a diver
could reach the bottom at this depth.

94
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,341
I'm not asking for your opinion.

95
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,844
You're free to go
once you've identified the gold.

96
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,598
But watch the hibachi.
I'll kill you if it dies.

97
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,435
You don't have to spell it out for me,
Mr. Bossy Britches.

98
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,938
Raise the rope
if I'm gone for more than 35 minutes.

99
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,608
-Got it?
-Thirty-five minutes?

100
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,906
I can stay underwater for 30 minutes.

101
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,297
<i>Boutarou the Pirate's feet</i>
<i>are a full 36 centimeters,</i>

102
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,803
<i>and he has strange webbing</i>
<i>between his fingers.</i>

103
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,891
<i>He worked as a lumber ferryman as a child.</i>

104
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,602
<i>He perfected his skills in the water,</i>

105
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,397
<i>but one day he started dragging people in,</i>

106
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,650
<i>drowning them</i>
<i>and stripping them of their valuables.</i>

107
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,237
<i>And with that, he became known as</i>
<i>the Pirate of the Prison</i>

108
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,323
<i>and also Boutarou the Pirate.</i>

109
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,706
Looks like Master Heita
already identified the gold.

110
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,210
I see. So if we head for these rivers,

111
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,255
we can catch the Pirate.

112
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,555
Come on, boar!

113
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,432
Yes! Boar-deer-butterfly combo!

114
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,853
I win again! You suck at this, Kadokura!

115
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,275
You checked the bottom!

116
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,153
No, I didn't.

117
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,280
This butthole peekerâ€¦

118
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,366
is checking out bottoms as well.

119
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,784
Shut up, you idiot!

120
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,619
Let go!

121
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,954
You butthole peeker!

122
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,832
These two just laze about all day.

123
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,752
We have a stray Ogata in our midst.

124
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,257
What have you been doing
since your time in Abashiri Prison?

125
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,759
Karafuto?

126
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,846
I have two gifts from Karafuto.

127
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,267
The first is information
on a woman named Sofia Golden Hand.

128
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,104
<i>She used to be friends</i>
<i>with Wilk and Kiroranke,</i>

129
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,231
<i>and she's the leader</i>
<i>of a group of partisans.</i>

130
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,485
<i>No doubt she'll come to Japan</i>
<i>to get her hands on Asirpa.</i>

131
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,199
<i>She'll be another force to contend with</i>
<i>in addition to Tsurumi.</i>

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,576
And for my second gift,

133
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:17,706
it would seem that Asirpa's finally
figured out how to crack the code.

134
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,545
We've gotta find her as soon as possible!

135
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,505
They're coming for us.

136
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,677
Sugimoto's group has to collect
the tattoos as well.

137
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:36,016
So far, there's only been two groups
collecting the skins.

138
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,353
That's Hijikata and Tsurumi.

139
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,083
{\an8}SAPPORO

140
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,461
Looking for a good time, young man?

141
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,588
Do I look like I got money to spare?

142
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,549
Is this where you're staying?

143
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,761
Not a talker? I like that.

144
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,013
My late husband didn't talk much either.

145
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,558
You're not Japanese--

146
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,625
Keep back!

147
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,419
So her throat was sliced open

148
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,006
and her insides
draped over her right shoulder?

149
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,092
It sounds similar to that prostitute
who was murdered in the slums

150
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,304
on the 31st of last month, doesn't it?

151
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,597
Was it the same man, Inspector?

152
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,932
Possibly.

153
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,642
Were there any witnesses?

154
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,061
Any potential suspects come to mind?

155
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,106
Come on. I'll buy you a meal
if you give me something.

156
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:11,069
<i>The famous poet Takuboku Ishikawa,</i>
<i>noted for writing </i>A Handful of Sand<i>,</i>

157
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,571
<i>traveled all across Hokkaido</i>

158
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,907
<i>as a roving reporter</i>
<i>for a number of newspapers.</i>

159
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:21,830
Sapporo is all abuzz
over a case of serial murders.

160
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:26,084
I've gotten a little caught up
in it all myself.

161
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,712
<i>Paper sales have gone crazy!</i>

162
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,300
I need petty cash, Mr. Nagakura.

163
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,636
Bring something that isn't
already in the papers, you twit.

164
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,056
What a terrible way to go.

165
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,266
Has he got something
against prostitutes, I wonder?

166
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,517
It is unacceptable.

167
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,395
I hope he gets caught quickly.

168
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,441
I've got a girl I'm quite fond of,
and it'd be a shame if he kills her.

169
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,569
I hope you break your back
and die in a ditch.

170
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,154
Kadokura.

171
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,075
Can you think of anyone among the tattooed
convicts who could be responsible?

172
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,161
Yeah, I can.

173
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,499
There was this guy in Yokohama who stabbed
a prostitute a bunch of times with a knife

174
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,584
and got sent to Abashiri.

175
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,213
If the killer
is one of our tattooed convicts,

176
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:15,384
then this commotion
is going to be a big problem.

177
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,554
The police will be on the lookout for him.

178
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,935
{\an8}<i>And those from the 7th Division</i>
<i>will come running</i>

179
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,729
{\an8}<i>as soon as they catch a whiff of it.</i>

180
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,151
Hey!

181
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,529
Who killed my horse?

182
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,951
OOURA HOUSE

183
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,039
This Sapporo Serial Killer case--

184
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,626
Smells like a tattooed convict to me.

185
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,086
Warrant Officer Kikuta.

186
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,672
You're going to Sapporo.

187
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,384
I'll stay here
and continue the search for Asirpa.

188
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,468
All right.

189
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,263
And take Superior Private Usami with you.

190
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,014
Fine.

191
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,352
I'd really rather not go
with Warrant Officer Kikuta.

192
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,938
The feeling's mutual.

193
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,567
I'm sure Usami
will prove useful in Sapporo.

194
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,454
{\an8}SHIBATA,
NIIGATA PREFECTURE, 1895

195
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,499
So, Tokushirou, how was the battlefield?

196
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,879
I discovered something
quite fascinating, Master.

197
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,672
And what's that?

198
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,468
All of the soldiers
should have been thoroughly trained,

199
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,970
<i>but when they got to the battlefield,</i>

200
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,306
<i>nobody actually fired their gun,</i>
<i>they just pretend fired.</i>

201
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:49,686
I hear the same thing happened
during the American Civil War.

202
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,773
They may have fired their weapons,
but they certainly weren't aiming.

203
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:58,195
<i>The vast majority of soldiers</i>
<i>are intrinsically opposed to killing</i>

204
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,238
<i>and do their best to uphold this ideal.</i>

205
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,616
Tokushirou!

206
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,367
You're back!

207
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,037
Hello! It's been a while!

208
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,332
You've gotten bigger again,
haven't you, Tokishige?

209
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,708
TOKISHIGE USAMI, 14 YEARS OLD

210
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,918
I have!

211
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,046
You don't look like
you're here for training.

212
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,550
I actually have some work to do at home,
but I ended up here.

213
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,553
Isn't it a two-hour walk from your house?

214
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,474
Somehow I just end up here
even on days with no training.

215
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,520
This may just be
a regular old corner of the dojoâ€¦

216
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,149
but it is a sacred place for us.

217
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,945
{\an8}TWO YEARS EARLIER

218
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,658
{\an8}Tokishige,
are you still working hard at the dojo?

219
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,076
I am.

220
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,539
Tokushirou says I'm the most talented kid
he's seen so far.

221
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,541
Tokushirou Tsurumi?

222
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,586
Who is that?

223
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,882
He's the swanky officer
who comes to Tokishige's dojo!

224
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,060
Now, that's hard work.

225
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,896
Thank you, Tokishige.

226
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,732
This'll definitely get me
some strong legs.

227
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,402
This is a low-lying area,

228
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:25,699
so in the spring we use a foot-powered
water wheel and drain all the fields.

229
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,950
It's quiteâ€¦

230
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,201
Tokishige!

231
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,330
Excuse me, Tokushirou.

232
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,833
Hello, Tomoharu.

233
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,711
-How is your father?
-Good.

234
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,716
Come on, Tokishige.

235
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,718
Let's do it!

236
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,347
Stay at my place after training tonight.
We can go to school together the next day.

237
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,601
Apparently,
Tokushirou's coming to the dojo today.

238
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,186
Come on! Let's go!

239
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,110
Do it with me, Tokushirou!

240
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,112
Do <i>randori</i> with me!

241
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,704
So you'll be graduating this year.

242
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,623
Will you still be coming to the dojo?

243
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,876
I'll have to help Father out
in the fields,

244
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,711
so I'm not too sure.

245
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,757
You're going to get so much stronger.

246
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,258
You should keep going.

247
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,927
You'd easily beat
every single person in your grade.

248
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,971
It won't be long
before you can beat me too.

249
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,476
I won't be able to visit the dojo
so much anymore.

250
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,686
Really?

251
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,899
Some issues have cropped up
in a place called the Korean Peninsula.

252
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,653
Tokishige!

253
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,946
Let's walk home together!

254
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,949
Stop!

255
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,495
That's all for today.

256
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,248
Thank you, sir.

257
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,673
Just a little bit more!

258
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,757
Once more!

259
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,425
What's gotten into you?

260
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,260
I'm done for today.

261
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,097
Come on! Just a little more!

262
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,808
I mean, I gotta go homeâ€¦

263
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,608
What's wrong, Tomoharu?

264
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,735
We have to lock up the dojo

265
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,697
so Master Takeda and I can go home.

266
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,409
I wasn't even able to beat him once.

267
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:38,081
This is my last time here at the dojo.

268
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,419
Tokishige!

269
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,965
I'm going to Tokyo after I graduate.

270
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,051
I'll be moving out into a dorm.

271
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:55,014
So today is the last day
I'll ever get to do <i>randori </i>with you!

272
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,393
He couldn't bring himself to tell you.

273
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,270
I already knew.

274
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,190
All right. You want to go a little more?

275
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,860
And you want to beat me before you go?

276
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,528
I'd really rather not, though.

277
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,489
I wouldn't want to lose
just for the sake of your feelings.

278
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,241
Of course not!

279
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,703
What kind of a friend
would do something like that!

280
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,787
That'd be the end of us!

281
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,503
Master Takeda has locked the dojo
and gone home.

282
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,424
You two spar out in the open here.

283
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,384
I'll keep watch over you.

284
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,095
Begin!

285
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,438
<i>If I can beat Tokishige,</i>

286
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,691
<i>then I can make it in Tokyo on my own.</i>

287
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,911
I can go more!

288
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,217
Stop!

289
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,266
Call a doctor!

290
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,852
I said I didn't want to do it.

291
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:28,608
But I did it because you told us
to spar out here.

292
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,695
If I'd known you were going
to do this to your friendâ€¦

293
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,156
Friend?

294
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,661
That fucker was always getting in the way
of me-and-Tokushirou time.

295
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,663
And his daddy.

296
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:47,377
You tended to him because his daddy
was such a bigwig in the 2nd Division.

297
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,586
Fine!

298
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,716
He'd be going to a military prep school
in Tokyo to become an officer,

299
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,678
which means he'll get even closer to you.

300
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,929
Fine!

301
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:03,059
He couldn't even tell me
and just kept looking down on me.

302
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,269
Fine!

303
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,398
But just now as you were speaking to him,

304
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,234
I heard the whole thing!

305
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,735
Yes, yes, yes!

306
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,992
You still haven't told him
you're going to Tokyo?

307
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,329
In terms of strength of feelings,
you're better than Tokishige.

308
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,206
Hold on to those feelings,

309
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,377
and I'm sure you'll become
even stronger than he is.

310
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,212
Really?

311
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,843
That was all I had!

312
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,804
You said I was number one!

313
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,348
You saw me for who I was!

314
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,934
That meant everything to me!

315
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,565
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,817
I thought he'd give up and go home

317
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,070
if I said that to him.

318
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,490
Oh? Is that all?

319
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,034
Thank goodness!

320
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,580
So, I guess he's dead now.

321
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,876
Guess we're both guilty of complicity.

322
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,095
I'm going to tell you our cover story,
so you'd better remember it.

323
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,105
<i>After that,</i>
<i>we made sure our stories aligned</i>

324
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:36,527
<i>and said that Tomoharu</i>
<i>got kicked by Tokushirou's horse.</i>

325
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,698
<i>When his father heard the news,</i>

326
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,785
<i>he ran out and shot the horse</i>
<i>in a fit of rage.</i>

327
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,874
This is where I first killed a man.

328
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,628
<i>Where I lost my virginity.</i>

329
00:20:55,171 --> 00:21:00,176
I've come to this sacred place many times
to reminisce about that day.

330
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,763
<i>The secret between Tokushirou and me.</i>

331
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,476
But I heard it from Master Takeda.

332
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,939
He said the kid's parents hate you now
and you can't stay in the 2nd Division,

333
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,943
all because your horse kicked
and killed that kid.

334
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,781
You knew that would happen,
but still you covered for me.

335
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,284
It is why I was demoted to Hokkaido.

336
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,956
But being further away from Central

337
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,458
means I get to move more freely.

338
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,043
Andâ€¦

339
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,673
I thought it'd be a great waste

340
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,802
to see such an interesting young lad
go down like that.

341
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,639
I'll be waiting for you
in the 7th Division.

342
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:54,647
So how do you get soldiers
to go beyond pretending to fire

343
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,275
and get them really firing at the enemy?

344
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:02,822
I once witnessed something that
led me to believe that people can overcome

345
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,284
their distaste toward killing others.

346
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,996
That incident has been on my mind
for quite a while now.

347
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,375
And then I think I found the answer
during the Sino-Japanese War.

348
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:19,255
If you want to bring out
the aggression in your soldiers,

349
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,676
you need not instill them with fear
or hatred toward the enemy,

350
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,304
nor even use political ideals.

351
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,597
So what do you do?

352
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,309
You use love.

353
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:36,731
But still, love leads to
an internal battle with guilt.

354
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,109
<i>How do you cultivate love</i>
<i>among your subordinates</i>

355
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,988
<i>so that they're willing to do any job,</i>
<i>no matter how dirty it may be?</i>

356
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,408
{\an8}This is the question
every commander must ask himself.

357
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:53,498
{\an8}Still, there are some people
who are simply born soldiers.

358
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,376
<i>Those who are aggressive and loyal,</i>

359
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,004
<i>and who feel no guilt or sense of remorse.</i>

360
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,173
<i>Soldiers who can kill people.</i>

361
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:07,136
<i>Those are the soldiers</i>
<i>you need in your ranks.</i>

362
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,598
This serial killer

363
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,683
{\an8}is definitely no thief.

364
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,646
{\an8}It's not like prostitutes from the slums
have any money or anything.

365
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,273
He's killing for the sake of the kill.

366
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:23,361
I just know he's going to return
to the scene of the crime.

367
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,697
He's the kind of freak
to come back again and again

368
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,909
to fantasize and masturbate over his kill.

369
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,121
<i>I know the feeling.</i>

370
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,252
<i>Next episode: "A Perfect Mother."</i>

LAKE SHIKOTSU - THE PIRATE

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,934
What? These guys were searching for me?

5
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,734
{\an8}EPISODE 48 - FIRE

6
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,028
{\an8}From the way
Boutarou the Pirate's talking,

7
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,616
{\an8}sounds like he's already pinned down
where the Ainu first hid the gold.

8
00:01:56,158 --> 00:02:00,079
But he also said
that finding it is a different matter.

9
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,833
And this rumor
that the tattooed skins are useless--

10
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,459
What's your take on it?

11
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,796
We should press on
with our search for the skins

12
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,258
instead of being swayed
left and right by confusing rumors.

13
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,637
Anyway, let's play along with it for now
and see what information we find.

14
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,524
Well, nearly at Ebetsu Port.

15
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,278
Too bad you're not interested
in becoming my retainer.

16
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,742
Did you hear how much gold dust there is?

17
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,327
Twenty kan, right?

18
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,955
But according to an old Ainu man,

19
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,375
it's in deerskin bags about this big,
and they're crammed full.

20
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,544
Each bag holds about 16 kan,

21
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,046
<i>and there are over 1,200 bags.</i>

22
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,424
<i>Mountains of them.</i>

23
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,517
What about it? Sounds dreamy, right?

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,021
What a shame
we can't chase our dreams together.

25
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,280
He saw inside your knapsack!

26
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,786
Here we go!

27
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,270
Gondou!

28
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,934
Let go!

29
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,436
I need air.

30
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,328
Asirpa, can you swim?

31
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,956
-Only when my feet touch the bottom.
-Better stay there!

32
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,956
<i>Pici-kor-kamuy chep.</i>

33
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,125
<i>Yupe!</i>

34
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:55,981
Sugimoto!

35
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,705
<i>In those days,</i>
<i>sturgeon migrated up the Ishikara River.</i>

36
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,917
<i>There is a theory that the name Ebetsu</i>
<i>comes from the Ainu </i>yupe o<i>,</i>

37
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,879
<i>meaning "many sturgeon."</i>

38
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,802
The ship's paddle wheel is broken.
We won't be able to dock.

39
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,346
We're stuck here
until another ship arrives.

40
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,598
Sorry, Captain…

41
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,604
This is your fault.
You really messed up my boat.

42
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,606
Get the hell out of here!

43
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,609
Sugimoto, the platinum that Heita had…

44
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,362
Oh, that's right. Well, then…

45
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,199
We will cooperate with you.

46
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,118
We will?

47
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,662
Did you save me
just because I know something you don't?

48
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,499
Changing plans
after hearing Boss Wakayama's story?

49
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,253
No. We'll continue the search for skins.

50
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,548
So, you want help finding prisoners?

51
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,051
I told you already, don't expect them
to help you solve the code.

52
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,679
The story that you heard from the boss

53
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,889
may be plausible,

54
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,391
but right now,

55
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,644
there are two forces
with most of the skins in their clutches:

56
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,605
<i>Hijikata's group and Tsurumi's group.</i>

57
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,777
<i>We can't ignore the fact</i>
<i>that two sharp-witted men</i>

58
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,696
are still searching for the skins.

59
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,780
Good point.

60
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:31,994
So you just need more hands
to get hold of those skins?

61
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,705
Listen here, Sugimoto.

62
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,209
Sure you're not just taking pity on him
after hearing his life story?

63
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,546
It's just a hunch,

64
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,842
but if this guy has identified
where the buried treasure is,

65
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,053
it may be the only way

66
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,724
to turn the tables on Hijikata and Tsurumi
and get the upper hand.

67
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,644
Maybe we should torture him
for information.

68
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,690
But if we go down that route,
he could just lie to us.

69
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,275
So we'll just have to cooperate.

70
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,195
I see…

71
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,575
But let's be honest:
You're starting to like me, aren't you?

72
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,327
Sugimoto.

73
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,290
Fine, then.

74
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,336
I'll tell you what I know
after you've got the skins.

75
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,046
For my own safety.

76
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,760
I hope we don't live to regret this,
Sugimoto.

77
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,805
If we find the gold,
I bet he'll hog it all for himself.

78
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,307
Isn't that you?

79
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,937
Look. Here comes Zukin-<i>chan.</i>

80
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,113
Let's head downriver to Sapporo.

81
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,949
What are you doing, Asirpa?

82
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,034
What's that?

83
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,703
I'm going to attach a <i>kite</i> to the mast.

84
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,959
Ainu carry around harpoon tips,
then search for a pole to hang them from.

85
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,127
Is that the thing you used on the whale?

86
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,255
That's the one. Good memory.

87
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,714
And now you want a sturgeon?

88
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,718
Well, you like seasonal food, don't you?

89
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,804
Well, yeah.

90
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,640
So, what's the story with you two?

91
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,059
She's my guide in Hokkaido.

92
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,143
Oh, really?

93
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,230
But you got so mad earlier.

94
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,024
Stop! You might hurt Asirpa!

95
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,902
She seems extremely important to you.

96
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,120
Wow! So many eggs.

97
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,083
We ate pickled ones in Russia,
but I didn't know one fish had so many.

98
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,087
You can basically eat
all of the <i>yupe</i> meat raw

99
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,882
or eat these black eggs
boiled together with other parts.

100
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,927
And of course, we'll eat the brains too.

101
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,721
I hope it'll be ready to eat soon.

102
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,889
But the skin's pretty tough.
Give me a minute.

103
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,058
Sorry, Sugimoto. Be patient.

104
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,562
Quickly. Come on.

105
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,447
So, Asirpa, you like sturgeon brains?

106
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,825
I like the brain of any animal.

107
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,994
Just add salt, and it's so tasty.

108
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,457
So you want the person you love
to love what you love?

109
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,126
Shut it.

110
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,586
Eat some black fish eggs.

111
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,466
Do you have any family?

112
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,926
Yes. My grandmother, Huci.

113
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,219
Only your grandma?

114
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,806
You and Sugimoto have been
traveling together a while.

115
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,559
She must be worrying about you.

116
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,229
Shouldn't you go home?
It's dangerous out here with us.

117
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,946
You're intent on staying together?

118
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,867
Yum! Even better than the pickled ones.

119
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,287
Goes well with vodka too.

120
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,874
It washes the fishy aftertaste down well.

121
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,294
I'm not here just because
I want to stay with him.

122
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,631
It's not that.

123
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,469
I have something that I need to do.
That's all.

124
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,891
<i>Pici-kor-kamuy chep</i> slices
and black fish egg <i>ohaw.</i>

125
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,435
Here, Sugimoto. Try the brains.

126
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,440
<i>Hinna, hinna, hinna!</i>

127
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,317

00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,277
Superior Private Usami.

133
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,406
I understand that the killer
may return to the scene of the crime,

134
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,492
but since we have no idea
when that may be,

135
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,578
do we need to lie in ambush all day long?

136
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,372
Besides, there are two crime scenes.

137
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,459
Wouldn't it be better
to question some prostitutes?

138
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,170
Usami!

139
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,131
No, not this way.

140
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,801
Over here? No. Here.

141
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,304
-Hey!
-Be quiet!

142
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,805
Don't say a word!

143
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,349
Over here.

144
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,519
It feels better facing this way.
It's the perfect spot.

145
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,105
This is a blind spot,
hidden from the view of the buildings,

146
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,274
and it's in the shadows,
secluded from the street.

147
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,902
The killer could get away unseen!

148
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,867
Whoops!

149
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,662
"Whoops"?

150
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,458
Where? Where did it squirt?

151
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,418
Usami! It's dirty under there.

152
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,090
Got ya.

153
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,803
I found it, Warrant Officer Kikuta.
Come and have a look.

154
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,849
At what? Your semen? Yuck.

155
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,976
No, the killer's.

156
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,314
Just like I thought, he came back.
Returned to the scene to pleasure himself.

157
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,150
Yes, yes. According to my deductions--

158
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,611
Don't touch that! You'll catch something.

159
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,782
The killer comes here every two days.

160
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,201
And the last time was two days ago.

161
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,496
So tonight's the night.

162
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,623
Oh, please…

163
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,875
Don't tell me
you're a sperm detective now.

164
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,753
<i>So what Lieutenant Tsurumi meant…</i>

165
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,257
<i>I'm sure Usami</i>
<i>will prove useful in Sapporo.</i>

166
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,050
<i>…was this?</i>

167
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,636
I'll recreate the situation again.

168
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,013
This time,
I'll judge the height and distance

169
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:10,308
to determine the killer's age and stature.

170
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,852
You can really do that?

171
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,324
What the hell is this?

172
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,118
I've found the killer!

173
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,203
Whoops!

174
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,297
It just gets weirder!

175
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,469
Usami, over there!

176
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,588
Got ya!

177
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,018
Are you okay, Warrant Officer Kikuta?

178
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,313
It went in my eye!

179
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,456
Did he do this?

180
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,249
While running away from us?

181
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,003
Good evening.

182
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,838
Good evening.

183
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:08,551
Where are you going in such a hurry,
Mr. Foreigner?

184
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,566
I have absolved you of your sins.

185
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,527
There. Much better.

186
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,162
Two murders in one night.

187
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,790
Perhaps it was a distraction
to help him escape,

188
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,459
or perhaps he's just toying with us.

189
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,294
Or it has nothing to do with us,

190
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,006
and he's just got his own plan going on.

191
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,758
I wonder if he will return.

192
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,388
The two of us can't keep watch
over four different crime scenes.

193
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,225
Perhaps that guy is creating
more sacred spots for himself.

194
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,393
Sacred?

195
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,646
<i>Too bad the killer got away.</i>

196
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,606
<i>But we saw his face clearly,</i>

197
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,942
and the mark on his penis.

198
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,781
Let's go and see the other body.
There's a bunch of nosy onlookers.

199
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,242
Maybe he'll show his face.

200
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,120
You go ahead first.
I have something to take care of.

201
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,377
Private First Class Rikimatsu Ariko.

202
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,799
Don't turn around.

203
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,055
Did you really think I wouldn't recognize
your familiar, bulky shape?

204
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:40,435
Lieutenant Tsurumi
didn't tell me you were in Sapporo.

205
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,520
Are you with Toshizou Hijikata?

206
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,356
There's always someone around,

207
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,026
so I couldn't report
to Lieutenant Tsurumi.

208
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,779
If anyone sees me, there'll be trouble.

209
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,782
I was with Shinpachi Nagakura earlier.

210
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,076
Hijikata's group already suspects me.

211
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,579
Same goes for Lieutenant Tsurumi.

212
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,915
Nobody trusts me.

213
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,584
Then why don't you join me?

214
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,668
What?

215
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,129
Listen up carefully.

216
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,132
<i>I'm the only person who trusts you.</i>

217
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,259
<i>Forget your Ainu father's dying wishes.</i>

218
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:17,222
<i>Forget Lieutenant Tsurumi's threats</i>
<i>to your family.</i>

219
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,141
<i>Both of them are headed for destruction.</i>

220
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:25,522
Central wants Tsurumi to find the gold,
but in the end, they'll get rid of him.

221
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,275
Are you a spy for the central government?

222
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,869
I am your child.

223
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,041
Newspapers! Newspapers!

224
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,170
Goldfish! Goldfish!

225
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,840
When a goldfish seller comes to town,

226
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,176
it feels like spring is on its way.

227
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,803
Goldfish!

228
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,974
Fireworks! Fireworks!

229
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,486
You look a bit bizarre
as a wandering Zen priest. Too burly.

230
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,405
I can't hide my muscles.

231
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,994
We've got to make sure we don't stand out.

232
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,371
What exactly are you supposed to be?

233
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,092
Good point. It's a little bit obvious.

234
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,220
Seems like there's been a development.

235
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:43,182
That bastard killer sent
a package to the newspaper.

236
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,728
<i>There was a human kidney inside.</i>

237
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:50,940
And the fourth victim
was missing her right kidney.

238
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,901
Barbaric…

239
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,653
There was a letter too.

240
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:59,449
The handwriting was so messy,
it was barely legible,

241
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,201
but I could just make out
"prostitutes are criminals"

242
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,121
and "I will kill again."

243
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,124
Then it finally came to me:

244
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,002
This guy is copying Jack the Ripper.

245
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,378
Who?

246
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,423
Jack the Ripper was
an infamous serial killer

247
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,427
<i>who committed endless murders in London.</i>

248
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,848
<i>At the time, the whole of England</i>
<i>was talking about it.</i>

249
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,101
<i>It even became a hot topic in Japan</i>

250
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:30,563
<i>after the case details were published</i>
<i>in the newspapers in Meiji 21.</i>

251
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,399
He killed them
by removing their internal organs,

252
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,445
just the same as our guy.

253
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,571
And that's not all.

254
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,700
There was something
that really rattled England.

255
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:43,785
HOKKAI TIMES

256
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,370
<i>The killer would taunt the police</i>

257
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,831
<i>by sending letters to the newspapers,</i>
<i>announcing his crimes ahead of time.</i>

258
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,460
<i>That was a completely new</i>
<i>approach to crime.</i>

259
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:57,715
The newspapers received hundreds of
letters from mindless copycat criminals.

260
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,636
Prostitute killings ran rampant,

261
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,722
but there are only five cases
officially attributed to Jack.

262
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,560
<i>He made each kill</i>
<i>almost every other month,</i>

263
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:13,398
<i>and he murdered the third</i>
<i>and fourth victim on the same night.</i>

264
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:17,902
<i>The Sapporo murders</i>
<i>seem to be an exact imitation.</i>

265
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,946
<i>Our killer is no lowly copycat.</i>

266
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,949
<i>It seems we have a worshipper</i>
<i>of Jack the Ripper on our hands.</i>

267
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,120
<i>Another well-known twist</i>
<i>to the London case</i>

268
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,498
<i>is that the killer</i>
<i>simply vanished into thin air.</i>

269
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,628
<i>The last murder happened</i>
<i>40 days after the fourth.</i>

270
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,132
<i>It was his fifth and final victim.</i>

271
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,886
In other words,
if we don't catch him within 40 days,

272
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,473
there's a chance he may be lost forever.

273
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,976
I won't allow it!

274
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,438
That's really riled up Takuboku this time!

275
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,442
One of my favorite prostitutes
has already fled to Tokyo!

276
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,069
You gotta catch this guy
as quick as possible!

277
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,155
I've got to get her back to Sapporo!

278
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,657
What a total scumbag.

279
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,495
I'm also curious
about a totally different case.

280
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,832
Hey, Sugimoto, did you read this article?

281
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,460
Another prostitute killing in Sapporo?

282
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,378
No, not that.

283
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,089
Children have been disappearing
all over the place.

284
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,551
Three just went missing in Ebetsu.

285
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,219
The town we passed through…

286
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,305
A child snatcher…

287
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,724
-Maybe it's him.
-You know who it is?

288
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,851
<i>His name is Keiji Ueji.</i>

289
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,605
<i>He murdered several children</i>
<i>and buried them in his garden.</i>

290
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,484
<i>He's a creepy guy</i>
<i>with a face covered in tattoos.</i>

291
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,319
-The candy man!
-What?

292
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,446
OUTRAGE

293
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,239
Keiji Ueji

294
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,618
must be a tattooed prisoner.

295
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:54,499
{\an8}Children have been disappearing
all over Hokkaido.

296
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,959
Recent crimes have taken place

297
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,254
<i>in Asahikawa, Utashinai,</i>

298
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,423
<i>Iwamizawa and Ebetsu.</i>

299
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,176
He's slowly getting closer to Sapporo.

300
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,264
What's going to happen in Sapporo?

301
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:11,766
OKHOTSK COAST

302
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,644
I received a telegram
from Warrant Officer Kikuta.

303
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,272
Two men stay behind
to continue the search for Asirpa.

304
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,942
The rest of you are coming with me.

305
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,236
To Sapporo!

306
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,576
I am your dutiful son.

307
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,995
Spare any change?

308
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,997
Give it up, Ogata!

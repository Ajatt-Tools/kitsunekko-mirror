1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,461
You want a reason?

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,173
I killed your father.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,594
Ogata!

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,559
The key is inside you.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,811
The most important key.

6
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:23,315
Kiroranke <i>nispa</i>, is it true?
Did you kill Acha?

7
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,403
Kiroranke <i>nispa</i>.

8
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,114
Kiroranke <i>nispa</i>!

9
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,501
<i>Come back when you've recovered.</i>

10
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,879
<i>I'll fucking end your life then.</i>

11
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,506
Asirpa.

12
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,676
I want to renew our partnership.

13
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,263
Okay.

14
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:08,736
<i>Toho toho to! Toho toho to! Toho toho to!</i>

15
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>Toho toho to! Toho toho to! Toho toho to!</i>

16
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:19,705
<i>Toho toho to! Toho toho to! Toho toho to!</i>

17
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:24,502
<i>Toho toho to! Toho toho to! Toho toho to!</i>

18
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,586
{\an8}KARAFUTO - BORDER
SUGIMOTO'S CURRENT LOCATION

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,256
<i>Sugimoto and company depart</i>
<i>from the Nivkh tribe's village.</i>

20
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,968
<i>They now approach the Japan-Russia border.</i>

21
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,637
GREAT EMPIRE OF JAPAN

22
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,311
<i>Toho toho to! Toho toho to! Toho toho to!</i>

23
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:46,065
SECOND MARKER - 1906
GREAT EMPIRE OF JAPAN - BORDER

24
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,192
See ya, Russia!

25
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,705
{\an8}SHISUKA

26
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:30,210
{\an8}EPISODE 37 - SEE YA, RUSSIA

27
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,321
We wired First Lieutenant about
joining Asirpa and crossing the border.

28
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,698
Good work.

29
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,202
First Lieutenant Tsurumi.

30
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,665
I can't wait to see your face
beam with happiness.

31
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,169
I requested he send his response
to the Toyohara office.

32
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,632
He must be anticipating meeting Asirpa
at his earliest chance.

33
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,512
Let's hurry on.

34
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,222
Let's be on our way.

35
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,641
We need to cover ground
while the sun is still out.

36
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,352
Wait a moment. Where's Sugimoto?

37
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,436
Huh?

38
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,521
MISO - SOY SAUCE

39
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,607
Great, I've stocked up on miso.

40
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,444
Asirpa's gonna be excited.

41
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,030
A whole bucket, Sugimoto!

42
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,494
He was with us a moment ago.
Where'd he wander off to?

43
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,666
-Get down!
-Shiraishi!

44
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,214
Shiraishi, can you move?
Find cover behind a building!

45
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,632
They got my leg!

46
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,260
Get inside the shop! You too, Asirpa!

47
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,763
Asirpa, don't move an inch.

48
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,727
Shiraishi is the bait
to lure us from cover.

49
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,187
This is a common technique snipers use.

50
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,689
Snipers?

51
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,275
Did you see the shooter?

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,319
Don't poke your head out,
First Lieutenant.

53
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,198
Tsukishima, give me your hand mirror.
I'll locate the shooter.

54
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,742
A hand mirror?

55
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,369
You don't even carry a mirror?

56
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,121
No wonder you got a filthy face!

57
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,457
Get my mirror from my bag.

58
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,376
Found it.

59
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,587
Don't dirty it
with your fingerprints, moron!

60
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,555
The attacker is shooting from long range.

61
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,726
Only one man can land a shot
from this distance.

62
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,271
Hyakunosuke Ogata!

63
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,106
Ogata is back already!

64
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,493
We can't take a single step.

65
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,661
What do we do now, Tsukishima?

66
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,798
I'll bust his head open
and stuff it full of miso!

67
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,759
That was Sugimoto.

68
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,136
I saw him advancing between the buildings.

69
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,513
He hasn't been spotted?

70
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,140
Ogata would not overlook Sugimoto.

71
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,020
Shiraishi, crawl yourself over here.

72
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,773
You'll bleed out without proper treatment!

73
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,860
Shut up! I don't need your help!

74
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,532
Tanigaki, let's push this sleigh over
to Shiraishi. We have to help him.

75
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,952
No. If the sniper really is Ogata,
then you're the one he's gunning for!

76
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,286
I'm helping him either way!

77
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,996
Stay put, Asirpa!

78
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,375
Hey! Doggies!

79
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,337
Look, a yummy Russian treat!

80
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,880
Come get it!

81
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,591
So you care more about the dogs than me!

82
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,346
Crows!

83
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,350
I'll scatter these snacks
and use the crows as cover!

84
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,853
That's it.

85
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,856
Hi-yah!

86
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,318
Adorable.

87
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,531
<i>I've seen that man before.</i>

88
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,826
<i>He was there, I'm certain of it.</i>

89
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,705
<i>Come out. I wasn't able to die.</i>

90
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,708
<i>Let's pick up where we left off.</i>

91
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,298
Is he toying with us?

92
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,008
We'll draw his attention.

93
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:50,012
-This is for the joint operation.
-Joint with whom?

94
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:56,226
<i>The attacker can safely shoot us from</i>
<i>a distance. He has the advantage.</i>

95
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,439
<i>Still, he is vulnerable</i>
<i>if we can approach him undetected.</i>

96
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,357
It's a nightmare

97
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,944
to get cornered by Sugimoto the Immortal.

98
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,409
<i>What was that?</i>
<i>Something got in the building just now.</i>

99
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,912
<i>It's very close,</i>

100
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,248
<i>like a bear lurking in the bushes.</i>

101
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,378
<i>A vicious creature</i>
<i>just waiting for the moment to strike.</i>

102
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,302
<i>I'll let him shoot first.</i>

103
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,473
<i>In the short moment</i>
<i>before he can reload and pull the trigger,</i>

104
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,725
<i>I'll lunge.</i>

105
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,605
<i>This gun isn't enough</i>
<i>to kill him outright. He'll shoot back.</i>

106
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,651
<i>If I want to immobilize him,</i>
<i>it will have to be at close range.</i>

107
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,029
<i>I'll finish you off</i>
<i>with my own hands, Ogata.</i>

108
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,537
<i>Mirror!</i>

109
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,378
<i>Naturally, I'm prepared for close range.</i>

110
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,883
Who the hell are you?

111
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,223
<i>Distance.</i>

112
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,603
<i>If I can get some distance,</i>
<i>I can shoot him.</i>

113
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,785
What's this? Did you draw it?

114
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,248
Halt! Do not come any closer!

115
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,166
You'll get shot! Halt!

116
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,712
What are you doing there, Mr. Soldier?

117
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,844
Looks like Sugimoto made it.

118
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,804
Asirpa!

119
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,056
<i>Sugimoto!</i>

120
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,019
You know Ogata?

121
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,023
Did you attack us on his orders?

122
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,443
Where is he? Speak.

123
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,323
What's that?

124
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,075
That's you?

125
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,371
Oh, I get it.

126
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,249
You're looking for Ogata.

127
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,630
Oh, you recognized Shiraishi and Asirpa.

128
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,675
These two are unrelated.

129
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,887
He's the bad guy!

130
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,807
That's right! Good!

131
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,852
Ogata shot me too.

132
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,771
Do you understand? Bang!

133
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,440
Hold on, I'll draw it for you.

134
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,027
Ogata shot me at Abashiri Prison.

135
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,196
He then captured Asirpa.

136
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,450
Ogata conspired with Kiroranke
and shot me and Nopperabo.

137
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,704
Though, I don't know
how long they've been working together.

138
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,792
No, not a spider!

139
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,670
Asirpa's poison arrow pierced Ogata's eye.

140
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,465
I don't think she meant to do it, though.

141
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:18,136
I gouged his eye out and saved him.
I didn't want his blood to taint Asirpa.

142
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,221
OGATA RAN AWAY

143
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,516
When I see Asirpa, I feel hope

144
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:27,896
that maybe that innocence I had as a kid
is still deep inside me.

145
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,689
She gives me hope.

146
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,656
-What are you doing, Sugimoto?
-Huh?

147
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:44,121
He must be a Russian soldier positioned
at the border to finish Kiroranke <i>nispa</i>.

148
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,873
{\an8}This man is dead.

149
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,210
{\an8}This man escaped.
We don't know his whereabouts.

150
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,838
{\an8}We are here for the child.

151
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,174
{\an8}We are unaffiliated
with the emperor's assassination.

152
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,428
Hey, Mr. Russian Soldier,

153
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,640
next time you're looking for someone,
why don't you ask if they're there

154
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,392
before you shoot someone in the leg?

155
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,978
Got anything to say about that?

156
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,231
Or is there no way
to say "sorry" in Russian?

157
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,113
Looks like he can't speak well
with that injury.

158
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,704
Go back to Russia already, dumb idiot!

159
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,800
That Russian's following us.

160
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,678
I bet he stole that horse.

161
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,848
Maybe he still thinks
we were involved in the assassination.

162
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,852
No, he's no longer interested
in Kiroranke <i>nispa</i>.

163
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,690
<i>He drew on the back of the wanted poster.</i>

164
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,569
Maybe he thinks we'll lead him to Ogata.

165
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,822
He won't give up
until one of them ends up dead.

166
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,658
If he ain't dead, he ain't defeated.

167
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,536
Do you think Ogata will return?

168
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:11,416
If you really are the missing key
to solve the code, then maybe.

169
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,212
But it looked like he tried to kill me.

170
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,964
Is Ogata really after the treasure?

171
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,391
Maybe he enjoys watching
the mayhem he created.

172
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,026
<i>Sofia is the only one</i>
<i>who can tell us the whole truth.</i>

173
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,530
<i>I'd like to go find her on the continent,</i>

174
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,618
<i>but Sergeant doesn't care</i>
<i>about doing that at all.</i>

175
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,372
<i>Their priority is</i>
<i>to take you back, Asirpa.</i>

176
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,875
<i>Even Tanigaki came all this way</i>

177
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,378
<i>just to bring you back to Huci</i>
<i>to make her happy.</i>

178
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,924
Kiroranke <i>nispa</i> and Sofia
planned to gather comrades in their land

179
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,842
and cross the sea to Japan.

180
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,555
Sofia isn't the kind of person
who would remain in Russia.

181
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,609
LAKE AKAN - ABASHIRI

182
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,194
<i>Back in the day,</i>

183
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,240
<i>Lake Akan's perimeters were settled</i>

184
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,325
<i>by miners and sockeye salmon fishermen.</i>

185
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,451
INN

186
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,829
Ushiyama and Hijikata.

187
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,249
We haven't heard from them
in two whole days.

188
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,876
Something must have happened.

189
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,713
They could've gotten lucky with ladies.

190
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,967
Even if they found trouble,
those two could handle it.

191
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,345
All right, I get it.

192
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,390
Please wait here, Nagakura.

193
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,309
Let's go, Kirawus.

194
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,313
INN

195
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,734
It's possible they were killed
while going after the fugitive

196
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,902
rumored to be in hiding near Lake Akan.

197
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,654
Those two, defeated?

198
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,284
You have a point.
The convict isn't much of a fighter,

199
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,994
but he's sly as a fox.

200
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,080
Kadokura, have you met this convict?

201
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,583
I used to be the warden.

202
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,297
I'm even more familiar with the wrinkles
of his anus than his face.

203
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,049
His anus?

204
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,302
<i>As a livestock vet,</i>

205
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,305
<i>this man looked after domesticated horses</i>
<i>all across Hokkaido.</i>

206
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,726
<i>Waichirou Sekiya confessed</i>
<i>to killing at least 30</i>

207
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,854
<i>using all sorts of poisons</i>
<i>such as strychnine, cyanide, and arsenic.</i>

208
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,317
<i>All poisons used to exterminate wolves.</i>

209
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,401
CELL NUMBER FOUR

210
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,737
<i>Miso masks the bitterness.</i>

211
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,241
I tested it out by mixing poison
in one of the three bowls of miso soup.

212
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,328
Wolfsbane tastes bitter.

213
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,165
Though he fussed over the strange flavor,
he licked the bowl clean.

214
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,795
Dumbass! Stop your bullshit!

215
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:06,758
No wonder you're a yakuza boss.
You're unbelievably lucky.

216
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,260
I like to watch luck play out.

217
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,180
I've killed many unlucky fellows.

218
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,228
<i>While working in the prison field,</i>

219
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,898
<i>Sekiya picked wolfsbane</i>
<i>without our knowledge.</i>

220
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,858
After that incident,

221
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,653
I had to search him thoroughly
every time he went outside.

222
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,656
I even had to inspect his asshole.

223
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,827
The poison would wreck him
if he stuck wolfsbane up his ass.

224
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,746
Like hell he'd hide it in there.

225
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,164
You're not very bright, are you?

226
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,170
I looked at his asshole for nothing.

227
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,176
<i>Ang ang.</i>

228
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:56,474
{\an8}Have you seen a man with a bump on his
forehead and a man with long gray hair?

229
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,809
{\an8}No idea, Son.

230
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,144
Kirawus.

231
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,439
There's an Ainu man over there.
Go ask him too.

232
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,236
Don't order me around, asshole checker.

233
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,698
I work with the man who hired you,
you know.

234
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,826
I'm always stuck in middle management.

235
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,086
Hey, chubby boy! Stop right there!

236
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,466
Did you see a ghostly old man
with long gray hair?

237
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,427
How did I do?

238
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,553
What?

239
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,807
I've seen foreigners dance in Hakodate.

240
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,186
What if I dance on skates?

241
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,729
An ingenious invention, don't you think?

242
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,816
<i>Thus the very first Japanese</i>
<i>figure skater was born.</i>

243
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,735
Whatever.

244
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,029
I've seen the man you're talking about.

245
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,157
Yesterday, I saw him standing
right around there.

246
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,409
Around here?

247
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,748
What's this?

248
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,794
Those are silkworm cocoons.

249
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:10,465
Inside them are pills made from either
arsenic, puffer fish poison,

250
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,218
strychnine, or cyanide.

251
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,429
Half of the cocoons aren't poisoned.

252
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,807
Choose and swallow just one,
and I'll free Ushiyama.

253
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,601
I don't intend to play your games.

254
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:26,231
I'll chase you to land's end
and skin you alive.

255
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,275
So you are Toshizou Hijikata.

256
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,446
What does a man like you plan to do
with the fortune of a lifetime?

257
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,906
I'm intrigued.

258
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,869
<i>He's got a horse. He can get away.</i>

259
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,790
<i>I used a sliver of puffer fish poison</i>
<i>to immobilize Ushiyama.</i>

260
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,503
<i>I buried him in a casket after stupefying</i>
<i>him with Korean morning glory.</i>

261
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,840
The casket has air inlets,
but he has no access to water.

262
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,634
You have no time to waste chasing me.

263
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,887
I have a copy of Ushiyama's codes.

264
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,766
He didn't hesitate to swallow the pill
when I told him

265
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,476
that I buried you.

266
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,023
If you are on the right path,
you will be blessed with luck.

267
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,693
You will have luck on your side.

268
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,571
If you swallow the poisoned cocoon,
then you were on the wrong path.

269
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,824
Now, try your luck.

270
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,712
Even though all the poisoned pills
had a lethal dose,

271
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,298
amazingly, he's still alive.

272
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,470
From the looks of it,
he swallowed puffer fish poison.

273
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,973
His allies will trade the codes

274
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,268
in exchange for Hijikata's life.

275
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,479
I have to hide him somewhere safe.

276
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,237
What's this?

277
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,492
The boy's statement
and these strange shells.

278
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,203
Now I see.

279
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,625
This case is a dead end!

280
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,210
Hey, you.

281
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:17,008
I was hoping for sockeyes,
but only smelts are biting today.

282
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,178
I don't need this much. Want some?

283
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,596
I'd be happy to oblige.

284
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,682
Fry them up and enjoy them with others.

285
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,519
Sockeyes are active around dawn
when it's still dark out.

286
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,897
You won't have much luck with them
around this time.

287
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,441
You aren't from around here, are you?

288
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,525
No.

289
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,114
Kadokura, look at all this fish.

290
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,575
Oh, smelts.

291
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,870
Let's snack on these
and wait for the other two at the inn.

292
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,038
Head back, already?

293
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,292
A single smelt out of the bunch.

294
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,837
<i>I stuffed tetrodotoxin in it.</i>

295
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,966
<i>This poison won't dissolve,</i>
<i>even if it's cooked or fried.</i>

296
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,552
Will you be blessed or cursed?

297
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,723
I have given you a fateful choice.

298
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,489
No way.

299
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,743
My bad, Kirawus.
These were gifted smelt too.

300
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,203
No, not that.

301
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,416
No, it's fine. I'm painfully aware.

302
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,044
A fire broke out and burned down my house,
nobody else's.

303
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,297
In middle school,
a group of 40 of us were walking together.

304
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,426
I was the only one who fell
in a manure pile covered by snow.

305
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,720
I've always had bad luck.

306
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,518
That's the hand I've been dealt.

1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,548
Listen, Usami. We're only scouts.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:10,010
We need to lie low
until Lieutenant Tsurumi catches up.

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:13,305
But if we're too slow,
won't the killer get away?

4
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:17,643
Hijikata's group might sniff out
the serial killer

5
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,729
and come looking in Sapporo.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,481
We can't face them alone.

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,070
Look, Kirawus! Someone dropped a coin.

8
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,199
What is it?

9
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:36,871
I just thought I heard the voice
of someone who is dead.

10
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,958
One sen!

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,210
It's your lucky day.

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,966
Sapporo is crawling with officials
who are after the killer,

13
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,471
and Tsukisappu's guys
are combing the prostitution quarter.

14
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,057
Lieutenant Tsurumi's lot
might show up too.

15
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,895
It's no easy feat
to escape the god of death.

16
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:03,481
Superior Private Ogata!

17
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,233
That you would betray Tsurumi

18
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,319
is something I didn't know.

19
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,323
I didn't think
you would be a traitor either.

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,536
How about disguising yourselves
as peddlers again?

21
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:26,837
Has a suspicious Japanese person
been this way, asking about gold dust?

22
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:29,381
It's a guy with a strange tattoo.

23
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,758
No one's been here,

24
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:36,013
but I heard there was a tattooed man
at the coal mine in Utashinai.

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,433
Seems like he was selling candy
or something.

26
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,355
<i>Come get your candy</i>

27
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,358
Hey, kid, wanna try some?

28
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,692
Can I?

29
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,320
Well, of course! Hold out your hand.

30
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,616
What? It's just coal.

31
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,663
Your face! You should see your face!

32
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,750
So sorry. Please forgive me.

33
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,337
As an apology,
I'll give you something even better.

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,922
Just follow me.

35
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,091
Really? What is it?

36
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,386
Just wait and see.

37
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:51,231
{\an8}EPISODE 47 - STEAMBOAT

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,194
<i>Come and get your candy</i>

39
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,740
<i>One bag is just two rin</i>

40
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,617
Hey, you. Octopus candy guy.

41
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,203
Will you take off your clothes
if I buy some candy?

42
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,080
What? Why?

43
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,208
Why? Because I want to have a look.

44
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,585
I was wondering
what kind of nipples you have.

45
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,839
I only sell candy in exchange for money.

46
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,427
-No free nipple peep shows.
-Well, then I don't need any candy.

47
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,180
My nipples don't come as cheaply as that!

48
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,642
What the hell!

49
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,644
Oh, dear. Looks like you'd better change.

50
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,562
Get off me!

51
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,231
Those guys are dodgy.

52
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,402
Must be rival candy sellers who came
to harass us. Let's rough 'em up!

53
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,281
Oh, no!

54
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,950
Don't roll in there!

55
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:55,212
Hey, boy, have you seen a street vendor
with a strange tattoo?

56
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,923
Yep. Was over there.

57
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,258
What? You're sure?

58
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,223
Candy for me, please.

59
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,817
Just watch. The candy will appear here.

60
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,652
No way. Really?

61
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,946
Boo!

62
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,908
Hey, candy man.

63
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,662
I heard that you might have
some unusual tattoos.

64
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,461
Really? I'd love to see them.

65
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,840
Peekaboo.

66
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,133
OUTRAGE

67
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,928
Are those all tattoos?

68
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,264
Good, right?

69
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,183
I did the whole lot myself.

70
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,643
Wow! All by yourself?

71
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,437
How pointless.

72
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,148
So those are his unusual tattoos.

73
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,199
What a face!

74
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,288
Thank you for your time.

75
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,873
LOCATION - SARU RIVER

76
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,459
What's next? Down south to the Saru River?

77
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,421
But I'm also wondering
about those murders in Sapporo.

78
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,007
We could go there first.

79
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:26,929
Boss Wakayama's look of disappointment
was also a great face…

80
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,019
You'll never find that gold!

81
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,482
<i>Come get your candy</i>

82
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,569
Asirpa,

83
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,532
did that guy really say
we'll never find the gold?

84
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,327
That's what it sounded like to me.

85
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,872
What now?

86
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:58,544
Shall we stop searching for the pirate
and go after that candy guy?

87
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,713
I should have stripped him naked
just to make sure.

88
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,425
Let's head to Sapporo for now.

89
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,138
We can take a boat
down the Ishikari River to Ebetsu.

90
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,389
A boat?

91
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,891
The route on land will be slushy
from the melting snow.

92
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,270
If we go by boat,
we'll save time and effort.

93
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,688
{\an8}TOPPU RIVER VALLEY
AINU SETTLEMENT

94
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,274
{\an8}Long ago, the Ainu buried some gold.

95
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,026
I heard a rumor that you know where it is

96
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,612
because your older brother was involved.

97
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,533
I heard that someone killed
my brother and others

98
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,452
before moving it
and hiding it somewhere else.

99
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,039
Where did he hide it? You know, don't you?

100
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,417
I do.

101
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,252
Boutarou,

102
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,839
how much can we trust
what this old man is saying?

103
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,677
By the way,
which river did the buried gold come from?

104
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,053
Do you know?

105
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:55,434
I heard that it comes from several rivers.

106
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,271
Toppu River, Sorachi River,

107
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,274
Saru River, Shiriuchi River…

108
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,361
<i>Exactly the same places that guy said.</i>

109
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:10,574
And where did they gather
all the gold dust together?

110
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,245
-Gondou.
-Yes?

111
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,372
Bring three more bales.

112
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,334
KAMIKAWA MARU

113
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,004
We'll reach Ebetsu before noon.

114
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,965
Zukin-<i>chan</i> didn't want to come with us?

115
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,384
He wanted to stay with his horse.

116
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,430
He's keeping his distance from us,

117
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,683
waiting for Ogata to show up.

118
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,687
He thinks of you as bait.

119
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,778
MAIL - ORDERS

120
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,036
Who are those men?

121
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,289
They're in our path and drawing closer.

122
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,543
We spent everything we have
in that Ainu village.

123
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,589
So before we set out,
we'll have to do a little work.

124
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,010
Aren't they that mob that people say
has been attacking ships?

125
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,055
You're right.

126
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,975
Well, they won't mess with me.
Let's get rid of them!

127
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,277
What was that?

128
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,654
Take that!

129
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,224
Stop the ship.

130
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,352
What?

131
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,396
The pirate!

132
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,775
Hello, Shiraishi!

133
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,069
Who are you guys?

134
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,323
Watch out! They're together!

135
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,825
No way! No, we're not!

136
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,870
Back up.

137
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,665
You idiot! He'll shoot you!

138
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,043
<i>I've got no choice.</i>

139
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,302
Well, how nice of you.

140
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,723
Hey, Shiraishi,
you've got one reliable henchman.

141
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,516
I'm impressed.

142
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,522
There's a steamboat headed upriver.

143
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,524
Uh-oh.

144
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>Wait a second, Sugimoto.</i>

145
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,380
<i>Don't kill him yet!</i>
<i>He might have some information!</i>

146
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,967
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

147
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,719
<i>Sugimoto wants to kill him!</i>

148
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>He's very impatient!</i>

149
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,433
We're looking for anyone who knows

150
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,438
where the Ainu first hid the gold.

151
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,025
Oh, you too?

152
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,737
So you heard it somewhere too?

153
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,865
That the tattoo code
can no longer be solved?

154
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,827
Boutarou!

155
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,204
There's another boat
coming into our path ahead!

156
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,129
Get the boat moving.

157
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,966
He's got a gun!

158
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,092
Robbers!

159
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,595
Block the doors and stay low.

160
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,516
They'll regret choosing to board my ship

161
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,727
as they rot in hell.

162
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,649
<i>In those days,</i>
<i>mailmen were armed with pistols.</i>

163
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,745
Don't try anything funny with me.

164
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,582
Come on. Go quickly.

165
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,294
Hey, open up in here!

166
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,008
Welcome to the River of Death!

167
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,264
A gunshot!

168
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,892
He did it! He got him!

169
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,311
What an incredible mailman!

170
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,731
<i>In all his 35 years of delivering mail,</i>

171
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,233
<i>he had never shot his firearm before.</i>

172
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,154
<i>But actually,</i>
<i>Vasily had fired at the same time.</i>

173
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,698
<i>It was his shot that made the hit.</i>

174
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,742
Asirpa!

175
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,286
Kiss my lead balls!

176
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,334
The passengers are under attack! Go back!

177
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,006
Uh-oh. They're following us!

178
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:19,966
Shift over.

179
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,101
Hey, hey, hey! He's gonna smash into us!

180
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,255
Yeah! How's that, Shiraishi?

181
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,882
Nice one, pirate! We got away!

182
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,594
Send letters from hell, you maggots!

183
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,683
Someone dropped this gun!

184
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,770
I'm the mailman from hell!

185
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,316
That guy is the biggest danger.

186
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,403
Boutarou! Three men down!

187
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,489
Who killed them?

188
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,785
There's some crazy,
messed-up mailman inside!

189
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,461
Only one shot left. Got any spare ammo?

190
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,465
Over there! That's the guy's knapsack,
the one that had the gun!

191
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,551
Wait! It's not in there!

192
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,682
How dare he attack my men.

193
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,979
Asirpa! Get down!

194
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,649
Get down!

195
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,078
Come on, then.

196
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,045
Stop! You might hurt Asirpa!

197
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,516
I'll be mailing warrants
to send you to hell, you scoundrels!

198
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,602
Time to die!

199
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,939
I swear I'm gonna kill that guy.

200
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,942
I'm clean out of shots.

201
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,153
There are more bullets over there!
Quickly!

202
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,784
Where?

203
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,665
Get out of here!

204
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,501
That bastard.

205
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,717
Sugimoto!

206
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,427
Asirpa! Are you hurt?

207
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,305
Boutarou.

208
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,101
The mailman's escaped,
but he left the loot.

209
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,354
Sugimoto!
We have something to ask him, don't we?

210
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,277
So, your name is Sugimoto?

211
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,243
Just over a year ago,

212
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,329
I met an escaped prisoner in Sapporo,

213
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,873
a yakuza boss named Wakayama.

214
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,044
<i>I was going to kill him and skin him,</i>

215
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,839
<i>but his henchmen surrounded me.</i>

216
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,217
You cannot solve the tattoo code.

217
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,720
Why not?

218
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,933
You'll either drown and become fish food

219
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,603
or be eaten by bears in the mountains.

220
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,023
Or perhaps…

221
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,695
your efforts will be ruined
by some other weirdo.

222
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,993
<i>He was so convinced</i>
<i>that obtaining my tattoo was pointless</i>

223
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:19,456
<i>that he didn't even bother</i>
<i>to take my skin.</i>

224
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,380
Doesn't that tie up with
what Asirpa heard that candy man saying?

225
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,715
You're right.

226
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,969
So I gave up on the skins too.

227
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,723
That may be so,
but where did the Ainu hide the gold?

228
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,602
Well, wouldn't you like to know.

229
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,608
You might be able to get close
to the area where the buried gold is,

230
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,987
but I doubt that Nopperabo
would hide it somewhere easy to find.

231
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:55,867
Even small coins in your pocket
can be hard to find.

232
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,245
So, how about we join forces?

233
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,832
I like you, Shiraishi. You're so funny.

234
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,462
And I like strong guys
like Sugimoto even more.

235
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,174
But we'll argue over
who gets the lion's share.

236
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,011
You can be important retainers
in my country.

237
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,390
There's that guy again
who never says anything with sense.

238
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:27,482
I'm gonna become king of a small,
warm island in Southeast Asia.

239
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,777
I'll grow fruit
and sell it in other countries,

240
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,613
and have my face etched into the currency.

241
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,492
And I'll have so many children
that they'll take over the country.

242
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:38,993
Doesn't it sound great?

243
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,038
You always talked about that.

244
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,336
Why does everyone want to run
a whole country?

245
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,922
Sugimoto, do you have family?

246
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,049
What? No.

247
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,344
Maybe you killed your whole family.

248
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,058
What? Did you?

249
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,476
I didn't kill them.

250
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:05,854
It was tuberculosis.

251
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,232
That's enough of this.

252
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,112
Then you understand.

253
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,282
My whole family died from smallpox.

254
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,659
No one would speak to us

255
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,536
or touch us.

256
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,539
We had no place to belong in our own home.

257
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,667
So as a child, I decided

258
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,713
that if I made my own country,
no one could drive me way.

259
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,840
King, right?

260
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,886
Nurture your dreams
and look to the future.

261
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,138
That's how I stopped living in fear.

262
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,474
Maybe that's why I never got infected.

263
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,643
I brushed it aside with my state of mind.

264
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,901
Saichi,

265
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,363
don't hope to find a hospital bed for me.

266
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,241
I won't last that long.

267
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,744
You are so kind.

268
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,665
That's why you always have bad luck.

269
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,378
I was also meddlesome by nature.

270
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,342
That part of me was hard to change.

271
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,804
I'll ask again at the hospital tomorrow.

272
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,361
Wait. Don't black cats cure tuberculosis?

273
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,323
You're no help either.

274
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,042
Off you go.

275
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,379
You don't want to get tuberculosis too.

276
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,507
Forget about me.

277
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,593
Living for yourself

278
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,639
isn't such a bad thing, Saichi.

279
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:10,645
<i>Go and find a place</i>
<i>where you can be happy.</i>

280
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,819
I won't give up.

281
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,910
<i>Try and kill me!</i>

282
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,496
<i>I am immortal!</i>

283
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,750
If you find the gold,

284
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,546
what will you do to be happy, Sugimoto?

285
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,173
Do you have a dream?

286
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,553
Boutarou! We've reached Ebetsu!

287
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,597
Sorry for all of the chaos, everyone.

288
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,182
As an apology,

289
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,603
I will refrain from robbing you
of your money and belongings.

290
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,108
I'll just take the mail full of money.
That's all.

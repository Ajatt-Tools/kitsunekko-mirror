You put a hole in my heart

235
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:53,124
Too late, no hope

236

Your lips shoot cold steel

255
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,861

01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:53,510
ライディーン！

349
01:14:55,469 --> 01:14:56,662
ライディーン！

350
01:14:58,669 --> 01:14:59,869
ライディーン！

351
01:15:01,853 --> 01:15:03,033
ライディーン！

352
01:15:04,973 --> 01:15:06,159
ライディーン！

353
01:15:08,213 --> 01:15:09,426

01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:53,949
僕は

360
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:57,022
この話を誰にも
してやらないことに決めた。

361
01:16:58,009 --> 01:16:59,109
来年の、

362
01:16:59,429 --> 01:17:00,588
次の年の、

363
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,109
また次の年になったら、

364
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:07,306
僕だって
もうすっかり忘れているんだ

365
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,560

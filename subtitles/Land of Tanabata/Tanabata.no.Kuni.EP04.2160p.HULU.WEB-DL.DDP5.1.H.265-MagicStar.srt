Within Reach, aren't you?

00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:28,557
It's just like the murder
that took place in Marukawa Town.

13
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:32,273
[Emi]
That Takashi person might be the murderer.

14
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:34,235
[Takashi] I see potential in your power.

15
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,114
There's something I want your help with.

You've come through for me, Masumoto.

23
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,675
I never thought
such a power really existed.

24
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:10,683
Much obliged.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,777
The assassination you ordered
on Councilor Tamabe

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,488
has been carried out without a hitch.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,874
But the incident in Marukawa Town
presents a problem.

28
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,761
Why would he do something so stupid,
at a time like this?

29
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:31,600
There is no problem with him.

30
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,566
He was simply trying
to protect his hometown.

31
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:38,279
As a person Within Reach.

32
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,914
I need someone more reliable.

33
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,427
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

34
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:54,896
The police have begun investigating
what happened to Councilor Tamabe.

35
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,069
What a hassle.

36

That's why…

So, how big has your power gotten?

[Yagihara] The dubious nature
of supernatural phenomena

96
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,097
often points toward the darkness

away from true scrutiny.

to simply prove that such things exist?

00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,817
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

168
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:43,030
[Takashi] How much did we make?

169
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:45,284
Over three million just today.

170
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,625
With him as the face of this thing,
we could earn even more.

171
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:55,764
Here. Your share for today,
Mr. Higashimaru.

172
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,393
[Yagihara sighs]

173
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,195
[Yagihara gulps, exhales deeply]

174
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,286
There are some busybodies around too.
We need to be careful.

175
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,417
But Mr. Minamimaru is easy to handle.

176
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,092
[Takashi]
I'm not sure if he's dumb or just foolish.

177
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,681
[Yagihara] Either one works.

178
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,893
We should increase the number of seminars,
shouldn't we?

179
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:20,563
[Takashi] Right.
[inhales sharply]

180
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,149
Should we do more in a different location?

181
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,404
[Yagihara inhales sharply]
Where should we do it?

182
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,324
[Takashi] Somewhere that pays well.

183
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:27,786
[Yagihara] Mm…

184
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,292
-Osaka, Nagoya, or Fukuoka.
-[Takashi] Right.

185
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:36,052
So, what did you find?

186
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:40,979
[Masumoto] The residents of Marukawa Town
have a stronger solidarity than expected.

187
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:44,026
There should be several more of them.

188
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,782
I want to find them at all costs.

189
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:52,878
I've gotten information
that there's one in Tokyo too.

190
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,763
Is that right?

191
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:04,442
What? 300,000?
[chuckles]

192
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,616
This much for one day?

193
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,162
I don't even need to get a job.

194
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,707
[laughs]

195
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,503
Woo!

196
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:17,468
This is crazy.
My power is amazing, after all.

197
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:19,388
Hmm?

198
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,061
[inhales sharply]

199
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,999
What's that?

200
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,218
[Nanmaru groans]

201
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:41,934
Maybe a pimple or something,
since I'm tired.

202
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:44,731
[sighs]

203
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,246
Marukami Village

204
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,462
[sighs]

205
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,597
Professor Marukami…

206
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:02,391
Why…

207
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,276
Why would you throw away your life here?

208
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:11,451
Is it that important?

209
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,507
[♪ pensive music playing]

210
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,113
[Professor Marukami] Emi.

211
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,467
-[Emi] Professor…
-[soft chuckle]

212
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:44,225
[Professor Marukami]
My roots may lie in that town,

213
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,605
but it's more complicated than that.

214
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:52,032
I am… drawn to it.

215
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:55,414
"It"?

216
00:14:57,502 --> 00:15:00,132
That festival that was held

217
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:05,142
just 10 days after Michiyasu Shimadera
was killed in battle.

218
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,820
Tanabata?

219
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,699
[soft chuckle]

220
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,118
Exactly.

221
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,084
That year, just as usual,

222
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,215
it began on April 29th.

223
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:33,741
That's right. April…

224
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:37,289
Just as usual?

225
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,234
The fourth year of the Einin Era

226
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,075
Marukami Festival held
from May 8th for seven days

227
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,452
[Emi] May?

228
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,733
Tagaya. Can you come to the seminar room?

229
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,781
[Tagaya sighs]

230
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,751
Tenbun Era. From May 23rd…

231
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:23,173
[Emi] It was mostly held in May.

232
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,513
It moves away from the date of Tanabata,
doesn't it?

233
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:29,644
On the Western calendar…

234
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:33,276
Western calendar?

235
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,117
[Sakuragi] It's 64…

236
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,835
All right.

237
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,676
[Tagaya] Hmm…

238
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:52,356
I know! Maybe they hold the festival
once the rice planting is done.

239
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,692
To pray for a good harvest.

240
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:56,531
No. Some were held in April.

241
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,663
[Tagaya] That might be fine in the south,
but Marukami Village is in the northeast.

242
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,965
April would be way too early
to have finished rice planting.

243
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:09,348
Yeah. Exactly.

244
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,229
How did I miss this?

245
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,314
Huh?

246
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,209
[keyboard keys clacking]

247
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,881
Convert Japanese calendar
to Gregorian calendar

248
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:29,597
Year 8 of the Tenbun Era

249
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,187
[keyboard keys clacking]

250
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:35,526
[mouse clicks]

251
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,868
[Tagaya] The dates pretty much match up.

252
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,707
It wasn't the Japanese old calendar.

253
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:46,005
The festival dates were set
to the Western calendar,

254
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:47,884
the Gregorian calendar.

255
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,223
The most recent Tanabata Festival
was also…

256
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:53,562
Look.

257
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,357
[Nanmaru] A festival.

258
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,818
Marukawa Festival

259
00:17:56,902 --> 00:18:01,077
[Nanmaru] "From June 18th… to June 24th."

260
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,287
That's seven days!

261
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:05,001
[Tagaya] June 18th!

262
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,715
Now I see!

263
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:13,434
But Professor, when was
the Gregorian calendar first implemented?

264
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:17,401
From October 1582…

265
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,910
and still only in
the Catholic countries of Europe.

266
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,373
Which means…

267
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:27,379
even before
the Gregorian calendar reached Japan,

268
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:31,888
it was already being used
in Marukami Village?

269
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:37,817
It must have something to do
with the purpose of the festival.

270
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:39,445
[Tagaya clicks tongue]

271
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:44,998
Everybody, let us once again witness
Mr. Minamimaru's supernatural ability!

272
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,795

-[Nanmaru] Huh?

290
00:19:57,392 --> 00:20:00,398
I never realized
you had such an amazing ability.

291
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,068
[chuckles]
Not at all.

292
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:03,697
[Asano] Please let me ask you something.

293
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,331
I understand that we need to train alone,
but could you give us just a little hint?

-[attendee 1] Yes, please!
-[attendee 2] Please.

Um… a hint for what?

You mean Beyond the Window?

299
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,687
Uh, that's something
only Marukami descendants can do,

300
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,650
and only a select few at that.

-Don't say that!

-No, I'm telling the truth.

-[attendee 2] What?
-[attendee 3] No way.

305

All of you!
You mustn't trouble Mr. Minamimaru.

-Aki?
-Come on, out of the way.

307
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,846
-Huh?
-[Aki] Excuse me!

308
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:38,725
But why?

309
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,186
[attendee 1] Please teach us soon!

310

-[Nanmaru] Sure…
-[attendee 2] Please, sir!

[Nanmaru] Wait, are you angry?

312
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,363
[Takashi] How much did we make?

313
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,618
[Yagihara] Over three million just today.

314
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,791
With him as the face of this thing,
we could earn even more.

315
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:56,468
Here. Your share for today,
Mr. Higashimaru.

316
00:20:57,513 --> 00:20:59,600
[Takashi]
There are some busybodies around too.

317
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,311
We need to be careful.

318
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:04,443
[Yagihara]
But Mr. Minamimaru is easy to handle.

319
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:06,698
[Takashi]
I'm not sure if he's dumb or just--

320
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,200
Turn it off!

321
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,046
[Aki] Nanmaru, you're too gullible.

322

[♪ somber music playing]

323
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:20,308
Why go out of your way to follow Takashi,
getting a part-time job too?

324
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:22,980
Why go this far?

325
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:31,915
I want to work for a newspaper
and become a journalist.

326
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,593
Not just cramped up here in Tokyo,
but traveling all around the world.

[Nanmaru] This feels wrong.

My power isn't meant for this.

There must be a better way to use it,

for yourself, don't you?

491
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:56,768
And you want to keep monopolizing
the wealth you've built up until now.

492
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,274
Why not at least take off your hat?

493
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:05,284
Remember, I'm paying 100 million for you.

494
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:07,623
[Yoriyuki chuckles]
100 million…

495
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,127
You can have it back if you want.

496
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,384
What's that?

497
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:17,935
[Yoriyuki] Currently, you live a life
without any hardships.

498
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:20,189
You have influence
in political and financial circles.

499
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:23,195
I don't know
whether people respect you or not,

500
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:24,865
but you are certainly feared.

501
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,328
What more could you want?

502
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:28,915
That's enough, Marukami.

503

[Yoriyuki] A lonely old man,
slowly sinking into obscurity,

505
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:38,350
wants to get his hands
on some exclusive toys…

506
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:41,315
You just want to show off, don't you?

507
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:44,029
[breathes angrily]

508
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,546

[♪ music intensifies]

512
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:27,992
[Yoriyuki] I'm faster than you can clap.

513
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:32,041
[breathing shakily]

514
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:39,097
[Yoriyuki] I'll join your collection,
for a limited time only.

515
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,482
[♪ dramatic music playing]

516
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,236
Let's get on well…

517
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,449
shall we?

518
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,006
An alien?

519
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:00,682
How rude.

520
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:03,730
I'm Japanese, despite how I look.

-[student 2] True.

-We should go with an asking price.

-Yes.

Well, yes, I am…

Professor Marukami has always been

363
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:19,974
in Marukawa Town.

364
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:26,946
I knew that.

365
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,996
But was hiding that fact

366

367

Still…

should know the truth.

Thank you for coming to Marukawa Town.

375
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:20,721
I regret not being able to see
Tagaya or Sakuragi.

376
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:25,062
I know that you continued to search for me
even after the students returned to Tokyo,

but we can no longer meet.

is conducting in Marukawa Town.

483
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:22,474
Everyone.

484
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:25,230
I have something important
to tell you today.

485
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:32,662
We all know about…

486
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:35,292
the amazing power of the Dimension Ball.

487
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,879
-Don't we?
-[Asano] Yes!

488
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:41,304
[Takashi] But of course,
there are risks too.

489
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:44,143
We are well aware of that.

490
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,605
That's exactly why…

491
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:48,401
we've been holding seminars.

492
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,865
So that you can learn
to use this power safely,

493
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,704
and eventually use it to help society.

494
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,206
That's what we have been hoping for.

495
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,459
[Asano] That's right!

496
00:30:58,379 --> 00:30:59,549
However…

497
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,891
that hope will come to an end today.

498
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:05,728
[attendees exclaim]

499
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,113
These managers,
who focus solely on the risks,

500
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:14,203
have come to recommend
the closure of this seminar.

501
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,374
What do you think about that?

502
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,585
[attendee 1] It's tyrannical!

503
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,296
[attendee 2] You can't close the seminar!

Mr. Minamimaru is on their side!

508
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:34,451
Nanmaru, wake up!

509

-[attendee 2] Traitor!

-[attendees clamoring]
-You've got it wrong.

511
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,756
I didn't betray anyone!

Listen to me, everyone.

This person is my brother.

518
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,132
But he's always been happy
to trick others.

519
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:07,852
That ability is inherited
by those from the bloodline…

520
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:10,775
of the Marukami Village,

521

and only by a select few people.

522
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:17,454
[Takashi] Marukami Village?

523
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,376
What is that?

524
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,007
-A ninja village?
-[attendees laughing]

525

What?

526
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:26,263
[Takashi] Listen up.

527
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:29,979
The Dimension Ball
is not a form of ninjutsu.

528
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:33,069
It is the proof of human evolution

529
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:36,033
that will one day be understood
in physical terms.

530
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,624
What are you saying?

531
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,170
Young lady,

532
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:45,385
a ninja village would suit you.

533
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,640
You should hurry back

534

and spend your life away in the mountains,
moping around by yourself.

-Right…
-No way. It's a lie.

-Yoriyuki…
-Wait!

00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,266
I get that you're different
from a normal human,

577
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:38,189
but is it really impossible
for normal humans?

578
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:39,441
Then what about Nanmaru?

579
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:41,361
[Asano] He's obviously a normal human.

580
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:43,407
Yet he can create such a huge ball.

since we've finally met,

[Mr. Hayano] The person's name

00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:17,470
is Yoriyuki Marukami.

605
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:19,600
In another era,

606
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:23,440
he would have been
the lord of Marukami Village.

607

[Nanmaru] Why would
this Lord Yoriyuki Marukami

608
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:32,291
want to make me disappear?

[Sachiko] Simply put,
to control other telekinetics.

613
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:44,441
He eliminates those who can't be managed.

614
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:47,740
That would explain

615
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:50,746
why he took my brother away.

616
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,710
Even my brother

617
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,256

618

ever come back to Marukawa Town?

620
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,865
Using the power outside the village
to align with other forces

621
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:11,453
is a violation of the laws

outside the village?

626
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:24,772
[Mr. Hayano] Why, you ask?

627
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:26,984
This power is to be kept

628
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:29,155
fundamentally secret as a rule.

629
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:30,909
Mm.

630
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:34,875
But is this really a power
that people are so desperately after?

631
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,419
[Mr. Hayano] Huh?

632
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:39,885
[Nanmaru]
In all of Marukami Village's long history,

633
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,518
many Within Reach telekinetics
have been born, right?

634
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,231
Didn't any of them

635
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:52,326
try to use their power
a little more constructively?

636
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,412
For example,

637
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,709
didn't they think of utilizing it
in some kind of work?

638
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,295
Out of the question.

639
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,340
It's a power
that must be kept fundamentally secret.

640
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,426
That's right.

641
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,056
-It ought to be kept fundamentally secret.
-[Sachiko] Better yet…

642
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,271
You should forget all about this power.

-Now that's extreme, Sachiko.
-Don't say that.

00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:09,820
-Sachi.
-Why not?

645
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:13,536
Nanmaru's not going to become a priest.
He doesn't need this power--

646
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,747
Stop it, Sachi!

647
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,626
Well, isn't it natural

648
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,548
to jump at new opportunities
whenever they arise?

649
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,638
You just don't get it, Nanmaru.

650
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:26,436
What can be produced
by giving a knife to a baby?

651
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,983
Sachiko, that's enough.

652
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,486
-That's right.
-Indeed.

653
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,574

Excuse me.

[♪ light background music playing]

656
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:08,980
[Nanmaru] The people of Marukawa Town
told me to stay here for tonight.

657
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:20,795
I'm sorry…

658
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:24,803
for being rude to you earlier.

659
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,519
It's fine.

660
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,276
What are you doing down here?

661
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:36,911
I feel like…

662
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:41,377
I don't know where to go.

663
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:51,231
Sachiko,

664
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,738
shall we go out for a bit?

665
00:40:58,245 --> 00:40:59,330
Right now?

666
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,259
-Here you are.
-[Nanmaru] Oh.

667
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:08,558
-Nanmaru.
-[Nanmaru] Yeah?

668
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:12,022
Shouldn't you have taken her
to a better restaurant?

669
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:14,820
Why? The ramen here is the best.

670
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,408
-Thanks.
-[soft chuckle]

671
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:22,794

[soft chuckle]

676
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:49,305
It's really delicious.

677
00:41:49,388 --> 00:41:50,850
Right?
[soft chuckle]

678
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:53,564
Thanks for the food.

[Nanmaru] Mmm!

681
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:09,638
[Sachiko] Wow.

682
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:26,964
It's beautiful.

683
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:30,847
[Nanmaru]
I thought you might not have seen

684
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,892
the view of Tokyo at night before.

685
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:38,779
I haven't.

686
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:43,831
[phone chimes]

687

[excited chuckle]
Finally!

688
00:42:54,435 --> 00:42:55,938
[Sachiko] What is it?

689
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:58,569
[Nanmaru]
The Trash Eraser has its first client.

690
00:42:58,653 --> 00:42:59,696
New Request

691
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:01,784
Trash Eraser?

692
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,833
Uh…

693
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:12,346
Just before, you saw my friend
at the ramen restaurant, right?

694
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,774
Together with him,
and a few other friends from university,

695
00:43:18,274 --> 00:43:22,534
I'm thinking of starting a new business,
using my power to make trash vanish.

696
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:31,802
I know you're against this power,

697
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:34,516
but I think it's a good thing.

698
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,647
I think that…

699
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,237
you could think about this
more positively.

700
00:43:42,197 --> 00:43:43,450
Both you,

701
00:43:44,118 --> 00:43:45,580
and the townspeople.

702
00:43:58,354 --> 00:43:59,566
Sachiko,

703
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,826
what about leaving that town
and coming to Tokyo?

704
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:08,166
If…

705
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:12,466
If we were together,
it would be really fun.

706
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,771
[♪ pensive music playing]

707
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:28,541
[Sachiko] When people come to Tokyo,

708
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,089
they go to Tokyo Tower, right?

709
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:37,934
Then look for where they live from up top.

710
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,984
There they have…

711
00:44:42,902 --> 00:44:44,154
their memories,

712
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,369
and their future.

713
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:51,753
[breathes deeply]

714
00:44:51,837 --> 00:44:53,464
I have nothing.

715
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:59,728
I'm scared to realize that I have nothing.

716
00:45:05,698 --> 00:45:07,242
That's why I'm fine…

717
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:11,375
to just look on from the side like this.

718
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:39,056
Nanmaru.

719
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:46,571
After this…

720
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:50,579
can I go to your room?

721
00:46:27,444 --> 00:46:28,822
Sachiko,

722
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:33,206
aren't you worried about your brother?

723
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:38,509
Not at all.

724
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:46,983
If I say this,

725
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:50,281
I might hurt your feelings, but…

726
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:55,543
Go on.

727
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:01,513
The people from the town,

728
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:05,521
don't they seem
really scared of something?

729
00:47:12,242 --> 00:47:13,494
Beyond the Window.

730
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:19,841
Everyone is scared of it.

731
00:47:23,347 --> 00:47:24,642
They've opened the Window…

732
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:27,982
and seen.

733
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:37,835
Beyond the Window…

734
00:47:43,471 --> 00:47:44,766
[inhales deeply]

735
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:47,605
You know,

736
00:47:48,523 --> 00:47:49,651
just before,

737
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:54,827
I was being pretentious, saying
you should look at this power positively,

738
00:47:56,246 --> 00:47:59,378
but even compared
to the other townspeople,

739
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:01,758
you're completely negative about it.

740
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,762
Why is that?

741
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,018
What?

742
00:48:11,778 --> 00:48:12,822
The other day…

743
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:15,953
I doubt this would happen much,

744
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:17,665
but I just happened

745
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:22,215
to save someone's life with this power.

746
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,469
That's why

747
00:48:25,179 --> 00:48:27,475
I want to think about the possibilities.

748
00:48:29,897 --> 00:48:30,899
But…

749
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,993
if I actually ended up
hurting someone else,

750
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:38,330
it would be pointless.

751
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,134
I'm sorry.

752
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:47,390
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

753
00:48:53,528 --> 00:48:54,530
No…

00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:58,789
I…

755
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:03,255
came here to talk about it.

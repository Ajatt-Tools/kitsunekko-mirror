1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,473
Another day with no progress.

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,516
SOMEWHERE IN TOKYO

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,228
I think it's about time
he showed me his face.

4
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:23,607
Hey, you ought to open the window
for ventilation sometimes.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,276
Fusui, how's it going?

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,321
Oh, hey, Henzo. You're back.

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,533
-I brought you some food.
-Thanks!

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,536
Thinking about the tournament...

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,745
HENZO KURE
KURE FAMILY

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,914
...the match should be
starting about now.

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,083
Are you curious about it?

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,585
Of course I am.

13
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,422
Mainly because, you know,
our representative is that Raian.

14
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,300
Why him, of all the people in our family?

15
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,221
-Oh, sorry!
-Never mind.

16
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,890
I know how crazy my big brother is.

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,809
Whatever people say,
he probably deserves it.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,269
FUSUI KURE
RAIAN'S YOUNGER SISTER

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,438
You think so? That sounds pretty cold.

20
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,900
But I do wonder what Grandpa is thinking.

21
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,861
Why does he want us
to monitor our client?

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,405
Yeah, it's weird.

23
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,241
Well, have you found anything?

24
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,204
We've been on a stakeout for four days
and the target hasn't shown himself once.

25
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,542
He must be in that room, though.

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,087
KENZO YAMASHITA, KAZUO'S OLDEST SON
REAL PRESIDENT OF UNDER MOUNT INC

27
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,880
Is everyone having a good time?

28
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,927
Please wait just a little longer

29
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,430
for the third game
of the first round to start.

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,559
In the next match, we'll finally
see the Kure Family's fighter.

31
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,938
The winner of this game is going to be
Ohma's opponent in the next round.

32
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,690
K. AKIYAMA, NOGI
K. YAMASHITA, YAMASHITA

33
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,066
We can't miss this match, Ohma...

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,194
OHMA TOKITA
FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION

35
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,574
The match could start at any moment,

36
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,409
where the hell is Raian?

37
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,077
MASAHIKO OHTA
PRESIDENT, UNDER MOUNT INC

38
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,457
I'm finally feeling better.

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,459
LIHITO
FIGHTER &amp; PRESIDENT,SH FROZEN STORAGE

40
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,419
I guess I drank too much last night.

41
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,838
Looks like you've been
having a good time, man.

42
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,507
RAIAN KURE
FIGHTER, UNDER MOUNT INC

43
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,135
-This guy's from the Kure Family!
-So active, aren't you?

44
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,555
What the hell? What's wrong with you?
Get the hell off of me!

45
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,183
What do you think you're doing?

46
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,895
Isn't it obvious?

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,192
I'm fucking with you,
self-proclaimed "Super Human".

48
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,445
I bet you're already aware

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,035
that there's no place for a normy
like you in this tournament.

50
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,413
Okay. I see what you're getting at.

51
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,291
You'll be dropping out soon.

52
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,044
I'm going to be the one dropping out?
Seriously?

53
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,090
Does this mean
you're picking a fight with me?

54
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:57,552
Damn right, you fool!
I won't let you take that back!

55
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,187
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

56
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,980
SAYAKA KATAHARA
DAUGHTER OF METSUDO KATAHARA

57
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,233
Now, please welcome the fighters.

58
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,320
Hey.

59
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,823
-Is it my turn?
-Raian, you made it!

60
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,581
The troublemaker of the assassin clan...

61
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,874
GAME THREE

62
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,960
...breaks into the tournament.

63
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:35,632
In the name of the Kure Family,
he'll kill anyone who stands in his way.

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,928
Standing 188 centimeters tall
and weighing 94 kilos,

65
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,848
he makes his kengan match debut today.

66
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:48,645
Representing Under Mount Inc,
also known as "The Taboo Descendant,"

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,815
Raian Kure!

68
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,953
Hey, do you see that?

69
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,123
Why on earth is he covered in blood?

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,754
Stop making a big deal
out of everything, you pigs.

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,006
What... the hell?

72
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,008
NAOYA OHKUBO
FIGHTER, MUJI TELEVISION NETWORK

73
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,593
Goddamn it!

74
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,554
RYO HIMURO, SUEKICHI KANEDA
EX &amp; CURRENT GINOKUNIYA BOOKSHOP FIGHTERS

75
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,181
-What happened?
-Raian beat Lihito up--

76
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,390
He didn't!

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,225
Yes, he totally did.

78
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,949
"SISTER"

79
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,579
Brother, please stay safe.

80
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,665
ELENA ROBINSON
YOUNGER SISTER OF MOKICHI ROBINSON

81
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,750
MOKICHI ROBINSON
FIGHTER, SENTORY

82
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,751
Thank you, Elena.

83
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,464
All right. I'm off to the match.

84
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,596
Now, please welcome his opponent.

85
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,641
This fighter was reverse-imported
from the UK.

86
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,605
His blue eyes are fixed only on victory.

87
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,901
With God's protection,
the holy warrior makes a sortie.

88
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,155
Standing 189 centimeters tall
and weighing 99 kilos,

89
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,242
his kengan record is
48 wins and no losses.

90
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:54,706
His net worth is 708 billion, 834 million,
900 thousand yen.

91
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,502
Representing Sentory,
also known as "The Exterminating Vicar,"

92
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,840
Mokichi Robinson!

93
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,850
Mokichi! Mokichi! Mokichi!

94
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,771
Elena, you're my everything.

95
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,567
For you,
I can be as strong as I need to be.

96
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,236
If you wish,

97
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,533
I will beat even God.

98
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,412
Mokichi! Mokichi! Mokichi!

99
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,832
Mokichi! Mokichi!

100
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,503
There he is!

101
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,796
ERIO KURE
KURE FAMILY PATRIARCH

102
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,089
METSUDO KATAHARA
KENGAN CHAIRMAN

103
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,549
It seems that the young man is
one of your favorite fighters.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,556
Erio, I know you set
a high value on Raian,

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,018
but this battle may not go as you think.

106
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:02,691
Fighting runs in their blood, you know.

107
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,902
-Blood, you say?
-Indeed.

108
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,571
Mokichi Robinson...

109
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:15,662
He benefits from what he has inherited,
just as you do in the Kure Family.

110
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,708
So, the blood of their lineage
is at stake in this battle, is it?

111
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,462
You are correct. This is not merely
a battle between two fighters.

112
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:29,884
It is a battle which will determine
whose blood will survive.

113
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,012
It's now time for the battle between

114
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,889
the elite assassin
and the reverse-imported fighter.

115
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,352
They're silently glaring at each other
before the match.

116
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,729
Take your stance.

117
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,818
Fight!

118
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,616
Not bad.

119
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,912
Wow! They're exchanging intense blows
right off the bat!

120
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,042
Go for it, Brother.

121
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,251
T. HASHIDA, SENTORY

122
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,294
We got this, Mokichi.

123
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,921
Is he really going to be all right?

124
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,966
Oh, boy. Raian is just playing with him.

125
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,468
He's incorrigible.

126
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,553
REICHI KURE, HORIO KURE &amp; HOLLIS KURE
KURE FAMILY

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,182
Actually, he's not the only one
who hasn't gotten serious yet.

128
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,937
Neither of them is giving an inch.

129
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,608
You can't take your eyes off
this match for a second!

130
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,654
It's fun to play with this limey jerk.

131
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,824
Now, how about this?

132
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,458
-What was that?
-He blinded him using his own blood.

133
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,176
Though he's not on my side,
I must admit that he's doing well.

134
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,471
Does that young man
practice classical jujitsu?

135
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,432
In the moment of attack,
he got him in hold.

136
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,477
There are differences

137
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,522
between modern combat sports
and classical martial arts.

138
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,399
One of them uses fingers.

139
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,401
Fingers are used all the time...

140
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,402
LOCK

141
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,071
...in every situation during a battle.

142
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,155
DISLOCATE

143
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,991
Having your fingers broken
means inevitable defeat.

144
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,076
BREAK

145
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,872
I give it a little twist here and...

146
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,459
It hurts, doesn't it?

147
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,174
He gets perfect points.

148
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,093
SUKIZO URITA
PRESIDENT, PENASONIC CORP.

149
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,469
That priest is pretty strong.

150
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,471
RYO INABA
FIGHTER, PENASONIC CORPORATION

151
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,723
It might mean trouble
if he makes it to the later stages.

152
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,352
It would not be difficult for me
to break your fingers now.

153
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,231
Do you want to continue, man of Kure?

154
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,692
You bastard!

155
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,862
Just kidding.

156
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,783
Don't think you can beat me
with little tricks like that.

157
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,746
-Wow. He broke free from the hold.
-Of course he did.

158
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,918
The Kure Family have lived as warriors
for 1,300 years, since the 8th century.

159
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,631
During that time we've married
the daughters of renowned martial artists,

160
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,010
at other times we've introduced
excellent seed from the outside.

161
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,432
Through selective breeding and adoption
of special techniques over the centuries,

162
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:28,605
the Kure Family has become
a race specialized for battle.

163
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,773
We evolve day by day.

164
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,904
There is no technique in this world
that the Kure Family cannot overcome.

165
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:43,077
Did you think you had me?
Did you really think you could beat me?

166
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,665
Did you enjoy dreaming, dumb-ass?

167
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,585
Dream, huh?

168
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,006
Then I'll make this dream come true.

169
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,434
Did you really think you could beat me?

170
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,022
Did you enjoy dreaming, dumb-ass?

171
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,071
What are you going to do, jujitsu dipshit?

172
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,866
Are you going to dodge it? Receive it?

173
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,495
What?

174
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,747
Was that a short uppercut?

175
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,377
That isn't a classical martial arts move.

176
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,254
That footwork...

177
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,506
Is that boxing?

178
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,639
What kind of move was that?
I've never seen this style before.

179
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,394
Mokichi Robinson uses
a unique fighting style.

180
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,562
It's Baritsu.

181
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,109
In the late shogunate period
in the 19th century,

182
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,279
kengan matches were dominated
by one fighter.

183
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,282
This man took techniques from other styles

184
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,284
and incorporated them
into classical martial arts.

185
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,121
His name was Shigenosuke Kotoura,
the master of the Musen Style.

186
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,667
He was one of the ten most extraordinary
warriors of the era.

187
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,795
This legendary fighter was known
as the Mythical Technician.

188
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,550
He left Japan in search of mightier
adversaries in the British Empire,

189
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,596
where combat sports
were thriving at the time.

190
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:30,601
By combining western martial arts with
classical martial arts and jujitsu,

191
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,479
he established his own style.

192
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,941
That is the unique combat sport,

193
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,610
the so-called Baritsu.

194
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,614
I see. The man we are watching
is the descendant of Shigenosuke.

195
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,657
That's right.

196
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,243
That's who Mokichi Robinson is.

197
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,791
Shit.

198
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,048
Full Shoulder Throw!

199
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,051
Please forgive me.

200
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,721
You were so strong
that I couldn't go easy on you.

201
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,149
He has failed me!

202
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:23,363
Goddamn Raian. You fool!

203
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,033
Dude. Raian lost as I expected he would.

204
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,618
This is unbelievable.

205
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,580
Uncle Horio, Reichi, brace yourselves.

206
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,542
This is not a fight anymore.

207
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,175
My throw was perfect.

208
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,929
How was he able to get back up?

209
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,472
That's it!

210
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,558
That was the way he beat me!

211
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,852
No way. Is he actually going to use that

212
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,189
in front of all those people? It's what
makes the Kure Family what it is.

213
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,357
R. KURAYOSHI &amp; R. MIKAZUCHI

214
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,068
The secret technique: Removal.

215
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,278
That bastard!

216
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:09,367
How dare he use our family's secret
technique in public without my permission!

217
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,998
I don't give a shit about fights.
I'm not interested in the outcome.

218
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,918
Do you know what I like?

219
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,504
I like total domination!

220
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,673
Especially through one-sided violence.

221
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:29,011
Now, it's time to dominate you.

222
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,264
How strange.

223
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,850
He looks like a totally different man.

224
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,813
Are you ready?
Keep your eyes open.

225
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,278
Mokichi!

226
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,081
His movements have completely changed.

227
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,042
Mr. Yamashita, doesn't this
remind you of something?

228
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,547
It does look exactly like that.

229
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,341
But it can't be the same.

230
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,054
Raian's form...
is different to what Ohma's was.

231
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,687
Normally, we humans can use only
30 percent of our physical capabilities.

232
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:26,360
The brain restrains it to protect our
bodies from breaking due to over-exertion.

233
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,489
However, improvements arising
from years of selective breeding,

234
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,784
means that our clan now have constitutions
which can withstand this surge in power.

235
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,164
By removing the limit, we've obtained the
overwhelming strength of the gods.

236
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,292
That's the Kure Family's secret technique,

237
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,252
Removal of restraint.

238
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:50,009
The maximum latent power we can remove
varies based on the individual's ability.

239
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,263
Raian is able to access
100 percent of his latent power.

240
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,434
Whoa! Raian threw Mokichi!

241
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,688
What a throw.

242
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:08,277
I lift you up...
and then I slam you down.

243
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,739
That's enough! Please stop it.

244
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,617
Why would I stop?

245
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,746
Raian's strangling Mokichi.

246
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,207
This is truly simple and truly cruel.

247
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:26,003
Will Mokichi manage to escape?
Or is he going to black out?

248
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,925
No way. He's dealing with Mokichi
as easily as if he was a child.

249
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,261
Wh-- What's going on?

250
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,763
It's brutal!

251
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,269
You call that a punch?

252
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,272
A fly could have a rest on your arm.

253
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,607
Get up, wimp!

254
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,194
Do you really think you will
ever be able to surpass me?

255
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,115
I hated my father.

256
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,450
Screw Baritsu!

257
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,496
I don't need
your old-fashioned martial art.

258
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,875
I left home when I was 14.

259
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,129
I dived into the criminal underworld,

260
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,882
and indulged all kinds
of vice using Baritsu.

261
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,928
It was a sort of revenge for the pressure
my bloodline had placed upon me.

262
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,558
But actually, I was only
pretending to be free.

263
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,103
My life had no meaning or value at all.

264
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:30,318
But you were the one
who changed me... Elena.

265
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,529
You're Mokichi, right?

266
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:38,367
Before he passed away, your father
asked me to take care of you both

267
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,037
This is Elena Robinson.

268
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,291
-She's your half-sister.
-My sister?

269
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,548
Elena, thanks to you,
I got back on my feet.

270
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:58,054
Thanks to you,
I learned how precious family is.

271
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,649
Nice job! Mokichi succeeded in escaping!

272
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,784
Mokichi, please stop now.

273
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,871
I don't care if you lose
as long as you survive!

274
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,541
Huh? You want to know the reason I fight?

275
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,630
It's so that I am strong
enough to protect you.

276
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,259
You are the most important person
in the world to me, Elena.

277
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,730
All I can do is believe in my brother.

278
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,111
Don't lose, Mokichi!

279
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,615
Thank you, Elena.

280
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:05,413
Even if I kill myself, I'll protect you.

281
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,042
And to protect our bloodline,

282
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,795
I will not fail to secure victory.

283
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,049
Now, taste this, Kure Family.

284
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,885
The secret technique of Baritsu,
Two-Finger.

285
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,439
I was just getting serious
and this is all you have?

286
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,484
You thought you could match me?

287
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,781
I don't give a shit

288
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,451
about this tournament,

289
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,454
the schemes of those old men,

290
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,706
you fighters,

291
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,666
or any other pigs!

292
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,961
There's only one thing I want to do.

293
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,590
I'm going to kill you all!

294
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,178
First one down.

295
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,181
Damn you...

296
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,982
Brother!

297
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,943
That's enough!

298
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,536
No.

299
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,664
He just died.

300
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,542
A man's life ends so easily?

301
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,967
KARURA KURE
KURE FAMILY

302
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,845
What's up, suckers?

303
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,306
Why are you so quiet?

304
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,184
Didn't you come to see...

305
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,354
the moment that people die?

306
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:59,568
Because this is literally
the "Life-or-Death" tournament!

307
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,948
Erio.

308
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,825
He is...

309
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,411
Raian is irregular,
even among the Kure Family.

310
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,289
He's a demon who slaughters
as many people as he wants.

311
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,086
It is simply impossible
to keep him in line.

312
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,006
Are you watching, guys?

313
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,927
Now you all know that I'm...

314
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,972
the strongest!

315
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,946
PREVIEW

316
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,530
Step by step,

317
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,450
an assassin from the darkness
